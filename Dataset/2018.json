The owner of the house might want to share these information with other people, such as doctors, family members, friends... So, I'm trying to figure out which would be the best way to handle the access permissions on these data.  Right now all the information are carefully encrypted and stored in a database (untrusted) and only the people with the right keys can properly decrypt those data. \n\nMy idea: I want to use Hyperledger Fabric to store and manage the access permissions to these files and also to store the hash digest of the gathered information for immutability purposes. Once the smart home generates an high level information from the raw data, it stores it inside the database and then it issues a transaction to Hyperledger Fabric with the timestamp and the hash digest of the data. \nThe smart home owner can share these information with other people, issuing a transaction with the ID of this person and an identifier of the data he would have the access rights on. \nSo before accessing the information stored inside the encrypted database, the application would check if the requester has the valid permissions stored within the blockchain.\n\nMy doubts and questions: since I'm really new on this topic, even though I've read a lot about it, I don't know if this would be an improper use of the Hyperledger Fabric. All the use cases I read about it, store all the data with Hyperledger Fabric, without relying on an external cloud storage service.\n\nSince all the transactions would be stored in the blockchain and the blockchain is maintained by all the peers inside the same channel (btw I would use just one channel to keep everything), they may be able to access to the Hyperledger Fabric database and extract information about the smart home. Am I wrong? If not, how can I solve this issue? I could use the identity mixer feature to \"hide\" the transaction issuer, but still the transaction would be visible to all of the peers who keep the blockchain available.","89":"I tried following this repo:- \n\nBut I  am getting the following error on compiling the code with :- \n\ncode = fs.readFileSync('Voting.sol').toString()\nsolc = require('solc')\ncompiledCode = solc.compile(code)\n\n\nIt throws out this error:-\n\n'{\"errors\":[{\"component\":\"general\",\"formattedMessage\":\"* Line 1, Column 1\\\\n  Syntax error: value, object or array expected.\\\\n* Line 1, Column 2\\\\n  Extra non-whitespace after JSON value.\\\\n\",\"message\":\"* Line 1, Column 1\\\\n  Syntax error: value, object or array expected.\\\\n* Line 1, Column 2\\\\n  Extra non-whitespace after JSON value.\\\\n\",\"severity\":\"error\",\"type\":\"JSONError\"}]}'","90":"I want to do TunaFish example from https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/education\nwith 2 peers 2 organizations like first-network instead of basic-network..please help me with this","91":"I've been studying Blockchain since a while and I've been looking out for information explaining where the blockchain ledger is saved and how it is saved locally (as in, locally in a full node).

I'm new to blockchain technology, and I'd like to get started by building my own network (to experiment).

That is, it seems like I cannot build my own network with Stellar. Is this correct? If so, what are the \"key words\" I should be look for to find blockchain frameworks that I can use to build my own network?\n\n\n\nEDIT: Let me elaborate a bit more. According to Stellar's official developer's guide:\n\n\n  In order to create an account, you need to run a CreateAccount operation with your new account ID. Due to Stellar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account minimums, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to transfer the minimum account balance from another account with the create account operation. As of this writing, minimum balance is 1 XLM (2 x 0.5 Base Reserve), and is subject to change.\n\n\nThis makes it seem like I cannot create my own network and must therefore rely on the official Stellar network for all of my applications.

As I will of course upgrade to entreprise plan and spend on the cloud (or Cluster) as much as needed once i do have a working stable concept that works.\n\nThank you in advance for all the help and service","271":"Can Somebody Explain Block Reward vs. Transaction fee?\nthese are separate benefits that miners receive?\nHow does it work?","272":"Let us consider we have n miners in our mining pool.

Then it passed the block to all n miners in the pool. \n\nLets assume that out block is as below:\n\nto_mine_block = {\n    Block No: 1000\n    Prev Block:999 \n    timestamp: \"1000-01-01 00:00:00\"\n    Data : \"XYZ\"\n    nonce : ?\n}\n\n\nNow,to_mine_block is sent to all n miners.

Although, from my understanding (please correct me if I'm wrong), in Fabric, CouchDB is supposed to be used as a state database that contains the latest state of the blockchain.

If that is the case, then the use of a Blockchain over a distributed database system becomes irrelevant altogether.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nCould I store my heterogeneous JSON documents in the ledger via transactions to benefit byzantine fault tolerance?

Apps using Fabric and Composer.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got just one question: while Ethereum is a public blockchain so you can deploy your Smart Contract on it and use them freely, can we do the same thing with Fabric? Let me explain: Ethereum has a running Blockchain on which we can work and access, but Fabric has not, right? Should I set up an entire new blockchain network before (setting up all the nodes, giving permissions etc.)?\n\nThank you","394":"First of all, I have contacted Bankera and no help is offered because this is an open source script. I have then contacted their community in their live chat and no one has any clues on how this script works(but would love to know) this is why I turned to Stack Overflow to get some help, this post will help a lot of users.\nI have to redeem commissions on some of my tokens, the problem is that I need to run this script to get them:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/Bankera-token\/BNK-ETH-Contract\n\nAs it says at the top:\nThe Contract has to have an Ethereum address in order to deposit a reward. Once the reward is set up for the weekly round, the claim amount will be proportionally divided among round token holders. For example, Jack, John and Bob have 1, 2 and 2 tokens respectively. If 100 ethers are placed in the round as a reward, Jack, John and Bob can claim 20, 40, 40 ethers respectively through the smart contract.\n\nI ran the first 2 commands and it created a node_module folder with all the dependencies required.\n\nstart init.sh\nnpm i\n\n\nI then ran this command:\n\nstart runrpc.sh\nstart run.sh\n\n\nAll I see is a black screen for 1\/2 second and disappear.\n\nWhere in this script shall I set my address to redeem the commission?\n\nAnd also how can I run the functions from this script?

It stores your wallet address or your public key. This public key can be used to see how many transactions you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done ever and if you even have the money required for the transaction. You also have a private key. \n\nIf you want to make a transaction then your private key and your transactions details are hashed together to create a signature. \n\nThis signature is broadcasted to all the members of the network, that is, the nodes.\n\nThe transaction can be validated to see if I even have the money that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sending by the members of the network or the nodes. This is done using my public key and the signature that was broadcasted. \n\nOnce validated, my signature or the hash of my transaction along with my private key is send to miners who get a lot of other transactions too. These transactions are hashed using the merkle tree and finally a block header is created. The block header is checked by the other miners to see if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valid or not. If it is, then it is added to the blockchain. \n\nThe blockheader is basically a hash of the root hash, the previous blocks hash and the nonce.","424":"I have setup a Hyperlder Sawtooth Network from

Also, I have a couple of questions to the Fabric developers about its performance.\n\nTarget description\n\nHyperledger Fabric v1.1.0 network deployed using Cello on four c5.9xlarge (36vCPU) aws instances:\n\n{\n    fabric001: {\n      cas: [],\n      peers: [\"anchor@peer1st.main\"],\n      orderers: [\"orderer1st.orderer\"],\n      zookeepers: [\"zookeeper1st\"],\n      kafkas: [\"kafka1st\"]\n    },\n    fabric002: {\n      cas: [],\n      peers: [\"worker@peer2nd.main\"],\n      orderers: [\"orderer2nd.orderer\"],\n      zookeepers: [\"zookeeper2nd\"],\n      kafkas: [\"kafka2nd\"]\n    },\n    fabric003: {\n      cas: [],\n      peers: [\"worker@peer3rd.main\"],\n      orderers: [\"orderer3rd.orderer\"],\n      zookeepers: [\"zookeeper3rd\"],\n      kafkas: [\"kafka3rd\"]\n    },\n    fabric004: {\n      cas: [\"ca1st.main\"],\n      peers: [],\n      orderers: [\"orderer4th.orderer\"],\n      zookeepers: [\"zookeeper4th\"],\n      kafkas: [\"kafka4th\"]\n    }\n}\n\n\nTLS is disabled.\n\nFabric channel configuration (all others parameters are the default):\n\nBatchTimeout: 1s\nBatchSize:\n    MaxMessageCount: 500\n    AbsoluteMaxBytes: 200 MB\n    PreferredMaxBytes: 50 MB\n\n\nI performed tests for both CouchDB and LevelDB as a state database. I use official Fabcar chaincode (Golang implementation) for my tests. I created simple nodejs app which interacts with the Fabric network using SDK and exposes HTTP API for load tests. This app is stateless and can be easily scaled.\nFor load testing, I'm using tool YandexTank. I've performed two kinds of tests with high load: query (requests via peer001 to the Fabric state when blockchain is empty) and insert (transactions within the blockchain).\n\nResults\n\nCouchDB as a state database\n\n\nQuery results:\nhttps:\/\/overload.yandex.net\/101153.\nAt ~1100 rps latency starts to increase. But Fabric instance is not loaded and have a lot of free resources. On the figure below you can see CPU and Memory usage by the Fabric network containers on the instance fabric001 during the test. 100% CPU usage means one full vCPU load.\n\nAlso peer001 prints a lot of similar error logs (not full output, just tiny part, I can share it with you if needed): https:\/\/gist.github.com\/krabradosty\/9780cacc92fcdeaa0c36377a91727ade\nInsert results: https:\/\/overload.yandex.net\/101217. At ~600 rps latency degradation is very fast. Before is slowly, but anyway, exist. CPU and Memory usage of the fabric003 containers on the figure below:\n\nA lot of error logs from the peer (again, not full output): https:\/\/gist.github.com\/krabradosty\/3810151b8e101d8279cc705aef22863e\n\n\nBased on this I can conclude that Fabric Peer has problems with the CouchDB connection under the load.\n\nMy questions:\nDoes Fabric comminity know about this bug? Do you have plans how to solve it?\n\nLevelDB as a state database\n\n\nQuery results: https:\/\/overload.yandex.net\/102035. CPU and Memory usage of the fabric001 containers on the figure below:\n\nThere are no any errors from the blockchain, I just see latency degradation.\nInsert results: https:\/\/overload.yandex.net\/102040. CPU and Memory usage of the fabric001 containers on the figure below:\n\nAggressive latency degradation starts at ~850 rps. No errors from the blockchain.\n\n\nMy questions:\nWhat is the cause of this latency degradation? Why I can't achieve 3500 rps performance that IBM report in their article? What plans does Fabric community have on improving the performance?","556":"Anyone know why my parameter is being seemingly ignored when I run the dapp? \n\nThis function is called when I press the button to send an X amount of money to a ganache account who's address I input into an HTML form while using the dapp.\n\n    App.contracts.EthereumPractice.deployed().then(function (instance) {\n        return instance.sendMoney.sendTransaction(addressInput.value, {\n             from: web3.eth.accounts[0],\n             value: etherAmount\n        }); \n    },\n\n\nI'm pretty confident the ^etherAmount variabe is not the problem as the money is being sent, it's just being sent to the wrong place (the contract adress not the imported ganache account address).\n\nMy solidity function takes in an address parameter and transfers the money to that address parameter value, so what am I doing wrong in the Web3 part?\n\nHere's the solidity func for those who just want to double check that\n\nfunction sendMoney(address _sendToThisAddress) public {\n    _sendToThisAddress.transfer(this.balance);\n}\n\n\nWhen my meta mask pops up it ignores the address parameter and instead transfer the money straight to the contracts address rather than to the import ganache account address, which I am trying to send the money to.","557":"I am new to Smart Contracts. When I saw some example of Smart Contracts, I realize that they are just some piece of code, not exactly contracts.\n\nFor example function sendCoin(address receiver, uint amount) is a method defined in smart contract which takes receiver address and amount to send Coins to receiver.\n\nBut the contract is not about how to send coins, but how much to send. For Example, if the material is delivered on time, make full payment else charge penalty of 10% for every week's delay.\n\nAs per my understanding, the invocation - where these if-then rules are written (Representing contract) - is outside smart contract.\n\nIs my understanding correct? Is the term 'Smart Contract' misleading?\n\nAre real contracts are still coded outside the block-chain in application triggering these functions? If yes, then why smart contracts can't be manipulated, the applications can still compromise the contract - For Example. by not paying as per contract terms.","558":"I get the this error when trying to run the \"Run Flow Tests Kotlin\" in the example CorDapp (https:\/\/github.com\/corda\/cordapp-example.git).\n\nPreview of logs :\n\n2018-05-13 12:19:36,091 main WARN Unable to instantiate org.fusesource.jansi.WindowsAnsiOutputStream\n2018-05-13 12:19:36,098 main WARN Unable to instantiate org.fusesource.jansi.WindowsAnsiOutputStream\n[INFO ] 12:19:37,608 [main] (AbstractSecurityProviderRegistrar.java:113) eddsa.EdDSASecurityProviderRegistrar.getOrCreateProvider - getOrCreateProvider(EdDSA) created instance of net.i2p.crypto.eddsa.EdDSASecurityProvider {}\n\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org\/apache\/commons\/collections4\/map\/LRUMap\n\n    at net.corda.node.internal.cordapp.CordappLoader.<clinit>(CordappLoader.kt:75)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork$MockNode.<init>(InternalMockNetwork.kt:221)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork$1.invoke(InternalMockNetwork.kt:100)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork$1.invoke(InternalMockNetwork.kt:93)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork.createNodeImpl(InternalMockNetwork.kt:374)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork.createNode(InternalMockNetwork.kt:363)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork.createNode(InternalMockNetwork.kt:358)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork.createNotaries$node_driver(InternalMockNetwork.kt:211)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork.<init>(InternalMockNetwork.kt:194)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.internal.InternalMockNetwork.<init>(InternalMockNetwork.kt:100)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.MockNetwork.<init>(MockNetwork.kt:217)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.MockNetwork.<init>(MockNetwork.kt:211)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.MockNetwork.<init>(MockNetwork.kt:214)\n    at net.corda.testing.node.MockNetwork.<init>(MockNetwork.kt:214)\n    at com.example.flow.IOUFlowTests.setup(IOUFlowTests.kt:23)\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\n    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\n    at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:50)\n    at org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:12)\n    at org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:47)\n    at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunBefores.evaluate(RunBefores.java:24)\n    at org.junit.internal.runners.statements.RunAfters.evaluate(RunAfters.java:27)\n    at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeaf(ParentRunner.java:325)\n    at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:78)\n    at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:57)\n    at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$3.run(ParentRunner.java:290)\n    at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$1.schedule(ParentRunner.java:71)\n    at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runChildren(ParentRunner.java:288)\n    at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.access$000(ParentRunner.java:58)\n    at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner$2.evaluate(ParentRunner.java:268)\n    at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.run(ParentRunner.java:363)\n    at org.junit.runner.JUnitCore.run(JUnitCore.java:137)\n    at com.intellij.junit4.JUnit4IdeaTestRunner.startRunnerWithArgs(JUnit4IdeaTestRunner.java:68)\n    at com.intellij.rt.execution.junit.IdeaTestRunner$Repeater.startRunnerWithArgs(IdeaTestRunner.java:47)\n    at com.intellij.rt.execution.junit.JUnitStarter.prepareStreamsAndStart(JUnitStarter.java:242)\n    at com.intellij.rt.execution.junit.JUnitStarter.main(JUnitStarter.java:70)\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.commons.collections4.map.LRUMap\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:349)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)\n    ... 38 more\n\n\nOS: Windows 10\nJava version: java version \"1.8.0_172\"\nJavac version: javac 1.8.0_172   \n\nComplete Logs:\n\nhttps:\/\/pastebin.com\/raw\/1pN5B5gZ","559":"I am creating a mining pool (blockchain thing). The thing is I decided to use the plugin https:\/\/github.com\/zone117x\/node-open-mining-portal which is written in node.js and using redis database for saving shares,payments and things like that. My questions are the following?\n\n1) Should I use redis database or transfer code to mysql?\n\nMy assumption is the following: Redis is supper fast, but I am worried about data loss. as you know , it saved information in memory first,then transfers that information to the disk. What if data is lost during this moment? I googled and there're some ways to minimize the chance of losing data such as RDB AND AOF. Will these 2 help me to almost minimize chance of losing data to 0.001% ? If I use mysql, It's much better because of acid transactions but it'll be slow because if I have 100,000 miners, for each of their share, i have to make 1 query to save data in mysql, and It seems for 100,000 miners there is a chance of saving 300,000 records in 1-2 seconds. That seems bad. On the another other hand, Mysql seems better for flexibility ,it will be easier to fetch data depending on any criterium. \n\nI need your advice . Just give me little advice.

The associates would need the ability to interact with the application (but aren't necessarily nodes (?)). Thus I would like to build a web interface, providing a way to easily interact with the blockchain. Each institution would like a different interface, conforming to their house style. Also, an associate has to be authenticated to the web interface to be able to use its functionality.\n\nAs I understand, each institution would run several nodes. Each node is able to provide a REST API to interact with the blockchain. Each institution would then run their own web service with their own interface interacting with the REST API (ran by one of their nodes)? and thus the blockchain. Then the web service would also have its own (institute-centralized and institute-specific) database which contains associate login details, providing a way to first authenticate the associate before having access to the actual functionality.\n\nIs my way of thinking about this wrong?

Now I make a token transfer and 2 records in balances changed and we get a new balances, and this transfer is confirmed by a new block 101. \n\n <------- [Block 100] <------- [Block 101]\n              ^                    ^\n              |                    |\n           balance1             balance2\n\n\nWhere does the balance is stored? Is it possible to retrieve balances in block 100? (I guess we must be able to do so, because the blockchain could rollback).\n\nI am using geth\/web3\/eth, it would be nice if you could direct me to the relevant documentation page.\n\nMuch appreciated!","691":"I am kind of new to hyperledger, and am currently trying to set up a blockchain application with hyperledger composer. I have defined my models, scripts and acces control logic. What I didn't understand is how the transactions I send through API get added to the blockchain.\n\nSo I started digging in the Fabric documentation, to understand the logic allowing a transaction to go from a transaction to a new block appended to the blockchain. I believe I have reached the full comprehension of the transaction flow and the elements it involves. I have returned to the implementation of such a flow but have come to an unclear point about the tools I should use. If I understand well, Composer is a tool used to build blockchain applications over the Fabric framework. Fabric allows you to define rules and the way your network works, including its various components (peers, orderers, channels...)\n\nThe question is do I need to implement a blockchain network \"from scratch\" using Fabric before I can build my application using Composer, or is there a way to configure the transaction validation process (add\/manage peers and endorsing peers, interact with the orderer...) and set channels directly on composer ?","692":"what happen if i tamper the data in h2 database\n\nI have  tampered with some hex strings but corda continued to work without any problem. i don't understand, how is that possible?\n\nthanks in advance","693":"I do not understand why we use .\/teardownFabric.sh before using .\/stopFabric.sh and .\/startFabric.sh.  \n\nPlease give me a clear idea if you know it clearly. \n\nThanks in Advance.","694":"When trying to instantiate chaincode in hyperledger with following command:\n\nCORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.gnaledger.org:7051 peer chaincode instantiate -C gna-channel -n gnacc  -v v0 -c '{\"Args\":[]}' -o orderer.gnaledger.org:7050\n\n\nI get following error:\n\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.195 UTC [msp] GetLocalMSP -> DEBU 001 Returning existing local MSP\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.195 UTC [msp] GetDefaultSigningIdentity -> DEBU 002 Obtaining default signing identity\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.203 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams -> INFO 003 Using default escc\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.203 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams -> INFO 004 Using default vscc\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.203 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 005 transport: http2Client.notifyError got notified that the client transport was broken read tcp 172.18.0.7:33712->172.18.0.4:7050: read: connection reset by peer.\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.209 UTC [msp\/identity] Sign -> DEBU 006 Sign: plaintext: 0A9A070A6808031A0B08FDA8EBD50510...1A000A000A04657363630A0476736363\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.209 UTC [msp\/identity] Sign -> DEBU 007 Sign: digest: 7EF3FD93154CC3D3809AA89E945DC21ADCD9EBB9E80BF1D516162F137078FF81\nError: Error endorsing chaincode: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Failed to deserialize creator identity, err MSP Org1MSP is unknown\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.213 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 008 transport: http2Client.notifyError got notified that the client transport was broken unexpected EOF.\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.213 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 009 grpc: addrConn.resetTransport failed to create client transport: connection error: desc = \"transport: failed to write window update: write tcp 172.18.0.7:33714->172.18.0.4:7050: write: broken pipe\"; Reconnecting to {orderer.dcmledger.org:7050 <nil>}\n2018-03-27 23:32:13.213 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 00a grpc: addrConn.transportMonitor exits due to: grpc: the connection is closing\nUsage:\n  peer chaincode instantiate [flags]\n\n\nFirst a broken pipe, then unable to find the MSP?","695":"Consider the following participants in a blockchain:\n\n\nSupplier\nManufacturer\nDistributor\nRetailer\n\n\nThe Supplier ships 1000 lbs of raw material, as a single unit or batch, to the Manufacturer. The information about this shipment is stored in the Blockchain. Then, the Manufacturer produces a different product based on the same raw material from the Supplier. At this point, the Manufacturer has their own product, units, batch, and so forth. For example, from that 1000 lbs shipment, the Manufacturer may produce 5 different products in different sized batches with different units. Then, the Manufacturer ships 2 of those products to two different Distributors, who then can take that and further break it down into different batches and units, which they then ship to their Retailers. Basically, the process is the same through out the entire supply chain, where the previous party provides something that gets broken down and transformed by the recieving participant.\n\nTo me, it seems like there will need to be many blocks that all \"relate\" to each other, based on some parent\/child relationship or dependency. For example, the supplier would be the first block\/parent. Then the manufacturer can have X number of blocks\/children that are dependent on that block, and so forth.\n\nAm I seeing or conceptualizing this wrong? Is there a better way?

In latest version they removed QuorumChain and added Istanbul BFT consensus. So it is new contract. \n\nAnd you can not find its source code in the Quorum sources.

The create transaction is signed by A and B node. \n  The create transaction request is always sent to Party A. It signs the transaction after validation. \n  Party A then forwards the request to Part B for signing. Once both parties have signed the transaction is sent to finality flow for commit.\n  Party C simply commits the transaction. There is no signing by Party C.\n  The state and ledger is stored on all three nodes. \n\nThe application has\n\n\n3 party nodes (A, B, C)\n2 notary nodes (1 simple, 1 validating)\n1 oracle service node\n1 Controller node\n\n\nCondition:\n\nWe started executing the create flow using JMeter (25 threads running in loop, max one request per second). Initially, the application responded well with response time at around 2~4 transactions per second.\n  However as the number of committed transactions increased, the performance started deterioting.\n  At around 200K transactions, the application crashed with with Java heap space error.\n  We have set the max heap size for java Corda process at 4GB.\n\nOur observations:\n\n\nIt is always the B node which crashes. Within our Corda flow, responsibility of this node is to sign the transaction and later on commit it to database in FinalityFlow.\nUsing netstat command on B node, it shows multiple connection in CLOSE_WAIT1 state and few in FIN_WAIT1 state.\nFrom the log it seems that, at first there is SSLException stating SSL handshake timed out for executing flows. After multiple such exceptions, there is Java heap space error. \nThe B node stops communicating with other nodes after certain time\/condition, which in turn leads to all these exceptions. However the reason why this is happening is unknown to us.","811":"With respect to Corda Nodes, Controller node serves as network map and offers\nvalidating notary service.

There are three prizes, the basic prize, the \"lucky\" prize, and the jackpot prize. The basic prize is given out 70% of the time, the lucky prize gets given out 25% of the time and the jackpot prize gets rewarded the final 5% of the time.\n\nThere are multiple people that get prizes each Monday. Each person in the giveaway gets at least the basic prize.\n\nRight now I'm just generating a random number and then assigning the prizes to each participant on my local computer. This works, but the participants have to trust that I'm not rigging the giveaway.\n\nI want to improve this giveaway by using the blockchain to be the random number generator. The problem is that I don't know how to do this technically.\n\nHere is my start to figuring out how to do it: When the giveaway is created, a block height is defined as being the source of randomness. Each participant has a userID. When the specific block number is found, the block hash is catenated to the userID and then hashed. The resulting hash is then \"ranged\" across the odds defined in the giveaway.\n\nThe part I can't figure out is how to do the \"ranging\". I think it might involve the modulo operator, but I'm not sure. If the resulting hash falls into the 5% range, then that user gets the jackpot prize. If the hash falls into the 70% range, then he gets the basic prize, etc.","819":"I am using ethereum studio from docker image , I am trying to run contracts but it gives error :\n\"Could not run sandbox.

The WebDollar uses the Mini-Blockchain scheme ( Ethereum alike ) by using Patrica Merkle Trees to store the Balances of every non-zero addresses and Smart contracts.

Is it a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfunction\u00e2\u0080\u009d that checks and validates the \u00cf\u0087 (validating a PoW blocks based Target (T), interlinks. I am right? ) or how Q predicate will look like ? What else will the Q predicate do differently than validChain (\u00cf\u0080, \u00cf\u0087) \n\n\nIII. MultiLevel Property \n\nWe are not very sure we got the order correctly. \n\nWe iterate u' from [0 to all u] and we will check that every u' must hold the property that for any C* included in C that has the property   |C\u00e2\u0088\u0097\u00e2\u0086\u0091\u00c2\u00b5'| \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 k1, C* must have also the last equation. in case C* fails the last equation we return false;\n\n\n\n\nIV.

Sorry for the ambiguous question. I mean to say when miners add this transaction to the block they are about to mine. Do they have to verify until the minted part.  So as now, its required to verify all the transactions to the point it is freshly minted. Right ? So when miners add this transaction into their they verify this transaction up to the minted point.   If this kind of work is on progress, can you please let me know any reference or documents that describes about this work.

You could implement a raw transaction system where you pass the raw (unsigned) transaction to the user, the user signs it and you push the transaction to your node (but the payer, in this case, is the user) 2. Depends on your implementation again :) but I would integrate with Metamask or Trezor for the raw transaction signing part.

The transactions are secure and verified by the nodes before adding to block.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Uahmed\n                \n                Jun 14, 2018 at 15:42\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                In the end  transactions are also just texts -use anything you want its your Block-Chain\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Sundeep\n                \n                Jun 18, 2018 at 11:53\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","473":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","474":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","475":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","476":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","477":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","478":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","479":"Is this the first time two nodes are connecting to each other to start the blockchain? or is your network already running on more than 1 node?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Fuzzybear\n                \n                Jun 11, 2018 at 11:18\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                This is the first time i am creating this set up.

So by saying you don't want tokens on your blockchain, you are basically saying you don't want smart contracts. In case of ERC20 tokens, it's smart contracts with a specific interface.

Let us assume I generate a seed with sufficient randomness. Now I want to store the seed and at any future points of time recreate the key and get the same public-private key pair. SHA1PRNG lets me set the seed of SecureRandom and it respects my seed value instead of ignoring it. Now assume I have a million users who have multiple keys, I just need to store the root seed instead of all their keys. Please read up BIP32 for more context. That part is solved in my code.

We will use these keys as generators to generate more keys which will never be repeated. So use-case does matter, also it's not a centralised system. I just provide an implementation, if someone wants to make their own keys, keep them private and use them for signing, they should in my blockchain.

First the error message invalid redefinition of constant Blockchain isn't related to your new_block function stuff at all. It's just that you can't redefine a type (struct) in Julia.

Basically, your original problem has nothing to do with your constructor, nor new_block. You cannot redefine the type, as the error already suggests. Then, when you solve that problem, you will face another one because you are trying to call part of an object which is to be created (not yet done)\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Arda Aytekin\n                \n                Mar 11, 2018 at 20:28\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    \n                \u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\n            Show 4 more comments","747":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","748":"I think it's a protocol specific question, and have nothing to do with graph or it's theories.

Where is the private key of contract address? I mean when I click on create button to create a contract it just return me with a contract address. Private key I have used here is of contract owner.

When I click for transaction it gives me that transaction successfull. When i see more details of that transaction that it gives me 0 token transfer from this address to that address. Also when I try to send transaction again it gives me gas limit exceeds 300000 limit.

If your wallet has 3 addresses to which 0.5 btc has been sent and not spent, and you then send 1.25 btc somewhere then all 3 of those 0.5 btc unspent transaction outputs will be used to build the 1.25 plus a new address for the 0.25 change. The sending wallet will also own the address to which 0.25 in change was sent. In this way a single btc wallet can end up owning millions of addresses\n\nIn practice it's quite likely that the total you send will be composed of multiple inputs so if you're trying to prove you send your grandma 1.25 BTC you don't look in transaction X inputs for your single address that originated 1.25, you look in tran X outputs for your grandma's address that received a total of 1.25. Bear in mind that in this day and age of multiple output transactions your btc transaction might cite 100 outputs, 12 of which are grandma's address and which add up to 1.25 btc\n\nYes, one btc transaction can hold tens or more payments to tens or more different individuals \n\n\n\nEdit in response to comment #1:\n\nThere might be any number of outputs, it's totally down to your wallet how it decides to send them out. Remember that if the inputs don't add up to the outputs then just like buying a packet of gum with a twenty dollar note, there will be some change. When you look at the transaction on a block explorer that your wallet built, there might be 100 inputs, 100 outputs (if you had a lot of people to pay) and even multiple changes if multiple inputs were split and sent back to yourself. If you think of your wallet bitcoin balance like blocks of cheese in the delicatessen, they all weigh different things, 3 people come and all want different amounts, the deli server person might get 6 blocks of cheese, have to cut them and combine them in different ways multiple times, then hand them over. They don't necessarily become recombined either; people might walk away with multiple little bits of cheese making the total amount they wanted, and then if they want to give that cheese as gifts, they subdivide it.. Ultimately subdivision of cheese continues until all you end up with are crumbs, that cannot be transacted because putting them all in one transaction makes the transaction too big (kilobytes) for the network to allow, so you might engage in an exercise of consolidating them; sending them to yourself in exact multiples so no subdivision occurs. Thus they become big lumps of cheese again. If you hear people talking about wallets being dusty, it means they're tracking large numbers of tiny amounts - dust.\n\nI think I understand the confusion now though; If two people agree to buy something from you for 5 BTC, one sends you 5 but the other is dishonest and only sends you 1. These may occur in the same block, but they wouldn't occur in the same transaction because they originated from different wallets. If your puzzle is over how to tell them apart, i.e. which person sent you the 5 and which person sent you the 1, this is why you get your wallet to generate 2 different addresses and give one to each person. You could always tell that you were sent a 5 and a 1 because of separate transactions, but when you look at the different addresses the 5 and the 1 were sent to you can know which person sent the 1, because of the address they used. Again, you're looking at the output side of the transaction, not the input side, because the dishonest person who sent the 1 can look on the block explorer and find out the input details the honest person used, and then claim to be the honest person.","18":"In traditional way of implementing things, each org will have its own code and their own data with them, so there is no trust among the orgs. HLF brings in the trust among orgs as all of them have exactly the same thing - same chain code, data and hence everything succeeds, and yes there is no scope to fail.

A blockchain is just a data structure similar to a linked list. Blocks of data reference their previous block by including their digital fingerprint or hash in their block of data. If a previous block is modified, then all the following hashes will be different and it is easy to detect if the data has been tampered with. This is not really a new concept (e.g. merkle trees).\n\nProof of Work\n\nProof of work extends the blockchain data structure by providing rules (agreed to by network participants) that enforce how much work must be done before a hash is accepted as valid (it must meet a maximum value threshold). The lower the threshold, the more work must have been done (on average) to calculate the block hash. Providing a valid block hash becomes a proof-of-work. This can make it much more difficult to modify past blocks, as the same amount of work must be done in order for the network to accept it as valid, thus distributed consensus can be achieved. This is why \"blockchain technology\" was invented, to achieve distributed consensus without relying on a third party. \"Blockchain technology\" is not really that interesting without the proof-of-work component and so it depends on what your definition of \"blockchain technology\" happens to be.\n\nPrivate\/Permissioned Blockchains\n\nIn the private\/permissioned blockchain model, nodes are only allowed to join the private network if they get permission. Not everyone can participate in consensus. Thus, consensus is controlled by the authority or authorities who allow new participants.\n\nPrivate, permissioned blockchain applications may or may not use proof of work, and do not allow anyone to join and participate and contribute to consensus by providing proof-of-work. Because the authority gets to decide who contributes to consensus, it is not a distributed consensus, but a federated consensus. If an actor becomes malicious, or doesn't align with their goals, they can be removed from the network. This is not the case with a distributed network, the work can be rejected, but they can keep attempting to submit work.\n\n\n  Okay. But i have seen that so many big corporates are moving to IBM\n  blockchain and also lot of projects on Hyperledger is coming up. Are\n  you saying that it all is a crap?\n\n\nI can't comment on projects without specific references, but I think one could assess whether or not it makes sense to use \"blockchain technology\" as defined above, for a given project. If it does not need to achieve distributed consensus, there are much less expensive, energy intensive ways to manage data, like a database, but I wouldn't consider that \"blockchain technology\".","21":"After a quick glance at the paper in question, it makes no mention of storage replication. The use case they are describing here is to use blockchain transactions as references to physical data that is stored somewhere. The data can be accessed by anyone who has the reference to it; i.e. access to that particular blockchain system, however the data is encrypted such that only parties with the encryption key can actually decipher it. This approach allows for quick validation of data integrity while maintaining privacy.\nFrom the perspective of the blockchain node all they see is a transaction that will be added to their local ledger, they don't actually save the data themselves.","22":"I just got the same error and what I did was prune my containers and such (restart network in short).

You should also familiarise yourself with private data collections, as this is another way of hiding some of the data from some peers. Which option is best for your scenario will depend on how your datasets are structured, and whether you also need to keep the data private from the orderer.\n\nClients are not part of the network. They query the blockchain by connecting to a peer and then requesting data from that peer. They can then only access the data visible to that peer (which is stored locally by that peer). So, it is not possible for a client to access more data than is available to the peer the client is connected to.\n\nIn your example, you would have a \"client\" organisation, with at least one peer. This peer would be part of the network, and your client application would then connect to it for access to data on the ledger (typically using the Hyperledger Fabric Node SDK).\n\nThere are two types of chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric.\n\n\nUser Chaincode (often just referred to as \"chaincode\") is used to update the ledger for a channel, and is only installed on those peers which require it (i.e. endorsing peers). Since your \"client\" peer would not be an endorsing peer, it would not have access to the user chaincode for the channel. \nSystem Chaincode which all peers have access to, provides (among other things) an interface to allow queries to be run against the ledger.","37":"No. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned network, so if an entity is not a part of the network, it is not able to access the ledger.\nA solution similar to what you ask can be done via Private Data, where peer A and B being in the same channel, can have data that is hidden from each other (Only the hash of the data is shared) and another part that is only shared between A and B but not C etc.","38":"There are many types of blockchain networks.

To run in parallel processing mode use sawtooth-validator --scheduler parallel -vv\n\nThe Sawtooth Validator also checks connections with transaction processors and those that do not respond (are hung or frozen) are removed.\n\nEdit: as for your follow-up question about DoS mitigation, there is a back pressure test in Sawtooth. Back pressure is a flow-control technique to help prevent DoS attacks. If the validator is overwhelmed it will stop accepting new batches until it can handle more work. The number of batches that validator can accept is based on a multiplier,  QUEUE_MULTIPLIER (currently 10, formerly 2), times a rolling average of the number of published batches.\n\nAlso, one can put the Sawtooth network behind a VPN.

The main problem that they're trying to solve is account management, the private key management, recovery process & good UX.\n\nAll of these need to be taken care of by yourself if you want allow your users to sign up for an account aka creating private key and store it securely in the phone. If hackers managed to reverse engineer and exploit your mobile app, they will be able to crack down the private key vault (the place where you store the private keys for your customers in their phones). You are screwed.\n\nMetaMask and the gang above have experts that know what they are doing and always put security as their main pillar in the engineering process. Apart from that, they also have design team that always come out with better UX ideas so that everyone can adopt blockchain easily.\n\nBottom line, if you have security and design experties in your team that know well how to handle the key management, recovery process (mnemonic\/seed phrases) & etc, it's probably a good idea to build your own inside your mobile app. Otherwise, I strongly recommend you just build web DApps and leverage MetaMask or DApp browsers above.\n\n2: Trust - the idea of blockchain itself it to make everything decentralize and transparent. When you build a mobile app for your DApp, means you making it centralize. Your solution lives somewhere, in a server.\n\nYou will be relying on Apple and Google everytime you want to push app updates. Imagine you are an iOS developer and Apple is taking very long time to review and approve your app update submission? There's nothing much you can do because you are in centralized\/close loop environment.\n\nIf you make it as web based DApp, you can deploy your DApp updates at any time you want. In addition to that, you also can host it to IPFS or Swarm to make it really decentralized application.\n\nThe beauty of not making it as a mobile app here is, your users can browse the code because all they have in their browser are static files; HTML, CSS and JS. Your users can tell if you are doing something bad in your code. Because they can right click on your web DApp and see the page source.\n\nBut if you are doing this as mobile app, your users can't really know what is 'behind' the app and you will find hard times to convince them later that they are in a good company.\n\n3: Development - Web3JS is the most popular and stable project right now. It acts like a bridge layer between your DApp UI and the blockchain. And of course, it's written and needs to be implemented in JS.\n\nEven now we started to see Web3 has been ported out to many other flavors i.e. for Swift and Kotlin, they are still new. Means, you will spend a lot of man hours later trying to debug and solve issues that only less people know to help\/fix it.\n\nTo share my experience, I'm a Rubyist and there are some Web3 flavors for Ruby now. But, from what I've tested, they are still far from perfect and stable and at last, I decided to port everything to Web3JS for front-end components and Go for back-end. components. \n\nFYI, the Ethereum Geth client is written in Go, check-out go-ethereum project. That means, everything that you need to do later i.e. creating transaction, signing transaction, querying blocks\/transactions, creating\/retrieving private key & etc has been tested and being used in real production. At any time when you are stuck, you can go ahead, read the source code of go-ethereum to learn how they do specific thing (the list above).\n\nI'm not going againts all these new flavors. What I'm trying to tell you here is, it's going to take time for all this new flavors to get matured and stable enough. My advice for you now, if you want to do DApp, use Web3JS. If you need some back-end work (your centralized server <> blockchain), use Go.\n\nI hope this helps!","117":"This is because of a compatibility issue in the contract compiler.\n\nYou will have to return to the point where you had built and deployed the neo-compiler.

Are there regulations on what data you can store on the employees and rights they have to get their data erased? \n\nThere might be many other simpler solutions that achieve the same thing.

You may also have a lack of trust between different entities within the same organization, and a private blockchain could help with this.\n\nEach member of your private blockchain will hold the ledger, so no need to trust a central authority (again even within the same organization) :\n\n\n\nAnd even if there are \"not many nodes\", it is still better to have to trust 51% of multiple decentralized nodes than 100% of a single centralized node.\n\nWe often see allusion to distributed databases, which are closer to private blockchains. But actually the closest technology would be rather distributed ledgers like Corda, IOTA (which uses a \"tangle\" and not a blockchain), etc. so blockchain is just another form of distributed ledger, but by far no more complicated to set up.\n\nCompared to a distributed database, in my opinion the blockchain brings you immutability, transparency (native history, no need to implement it), better security and greatly simplifies synchronization (no need for jobs, materialized views, triggers, scripts, etc.). And especially removes centralized control (any provider of a centralized solution can technically and more or less easily alter your data without leaving a trace (delete logs, backups, etc.), in a blockchain it is very difficult). We could also talk about higher availability and certainly lower implementation\/maintenance cost.\n\nPrivate blockchains can also be \"permissioned\" or \"permissionless\", following this anonymity\/trust schema :\n\n\n\nIn permissioned blockchains, permissions and roles management is interesting because in addition to the application level, they are controlled at the persistence level for each transaction, so it is not limited as often to a technical user used to access the database. Thus an invalid transaction will be automatically refused by the network even if your client application has a security breach.\n\nThen you have many other interesting things like smart contracts that allow you to guarantee an immutable process. You can for example formal audit a contract with other entities in your network, or with a customer, and confirm with him that the data processing will be done in such a way and only in this way, or even trigger actions at a specific date, etc. In some private blockchain like Hyperledger Fabric you also have the concept of channels if you still need some confidentiality within the same blockchain (isolation of transactions), which again would not be easy to set up in a distributed or even centralized database.\n\nBlockchain is a hot topic at the moment and everyone is trying to get in for anything and everything (FOMO), but of course if you don't need that points (trust, immutability, etc.) you may still go with a traditional central database, which will not require new skills and probably be more performant (even if private blockchains can reach several thousand transactions per second). Also permissioned blockchains are not intended for use with a very large number of participants (you have to identify them), so you may again fall back to a database or a private permisionless blockchain like Hyperledger Sawtooth.","136":"They both support EVM, but are separate implementations of EVM.

This attack works because this way you have beaten any other potential miners in the rate of producing of new blocks, so you are always producing blocks faster than anybody else on the network, hence ensuring that your chain will become longest.\nSo your evilminer, given that he has 10 percent of mining power, would never be able to advance the length of his chain beyond the main chain. The only other possible way is to use a nonce of lower difficulty to speed up block production, but such a block would be rejected by any other node in the network deeming it as invalid. \n\n\nHence, in short the only way evilminer can make other nodes accept his blocks is to make his chain the longest, and that can only be done if he has more than 50 percent mining power of the network.\n\nEdit 1 :\nConsider the computation power of every participant of the network and assume that when you sum these up, you get 100.

It maybe possible that someone having mere 0.5 percent of total computation power finds the nonce first. However, the faster you can crunch these numbers, the higher the chance that you will find the nonce first.\n\nSo if somehow you have more than 50 percent of total computation power, that means you are processing these hashes faster than anybody else, and hence this increases the likelihood that you find the nonce first most of the times. \n\nAlso, this process of finding the nonce, is repeated for every block. So the work has to be done all over again for every block.","145":null,"146":null,"147":null,"148":"You shouldn't hide your client code because it kills the concent of blockchain and decentralized technology itself.\n\nTechnologies such as Bitcoin are unbreakable as long as 51% of computing power (in case of PoW consesus) comes from honest nodes.\n\nIn the moment that more than 51% of computing power is corrupted (malicious) then the ledger is not safe.\n\nAs many maximalist may suggest if your intent is to build your own blockchain probably you should re-use code that is already written and considered to be safe and add your features step by step. \n\nWriting a DLT is not only about writing bug-less code (that cannot be used to corrupt all the nodes, as you stated in the question) but also efficient consensus mechanisms that cannot be exploited.\n\nPoW stands for Proof of Work.\nDLT stands for Distribuited Ledger Technology (which includes Blockchain, Tangles etc.)\n\nJust also to clarify some misconceptions which I've seen going out here.\n\nSolidity is a deterministic language used to write smart contracts inside the blockchain (it is not the language used to code the blockchain itself but the code used for the softwares running inside the blockchain, example: Ethereum)\n\nTaking Ethereum as example there are different implementations of it, geth (golang-ethereum) being the most active. As I told you if you want to create your own blockchain probably you should look to reuse code that is already proven to be solid.\n\nAnswering to: \"new blockchain are prone to 51% attacks\" (this plagues Proof of Work-consensus blockchains mainly): yes this is absolutely true, new born blockchains (or blockchains with low hash-rates) tend to be attacked frequently by renting hashpower (see Bitcoin Private case happened recently or Bitcoin gold). Unfortunately there's no way to prevent this from happening because it's just how Proof of Work consensus work, the only thing that can be done to contain it is that you wait more block confirmations before considering the assets coming from the transaction to be spendable.\n\nExample (names are chosen randomly): I have an online store accepting BTW (coin) coming from Bitcoin Weak's blockchain which is often plagued by 51% attacks, what I do is that although customers transaction was inserted in block number (X) I wait up until block number (X + 100) before allowing him to spend those money in my platform. \n\nWhy do I do this? It's because 51% attacks aim to recreate two chains and insert the longer chain later on which deletes the shorter chain (the one where I created the transaction used to buy on your platform) so the longer confirmation blocks I await the more money I force the hacker to spend to keep the 51% hashrate attack going. If his double spend attack consists in spending 100$ but I force him to spend 101$ in electricity (or hashpower rent) then I discourage him to attack the chain and try to double spend in my platform.\n\nHope this clarified your doubts.","149":"I don't see the error that you are having when I try to compile it.

The purpose that SPV states is that any client who is transacting on the chain can just store the path of hashes from the root to their transaction instead of storing the whole ledger, which can be very large in size. \n\nWe do not trust the block ?\nOnce your transaction is processed, you can verify that it has been added to the ledger by tracing the path from root provided in the block to the leaf node that is your transaction. So you verify to ensure if your transaction was actually processed or not.\n\nCan it be faked ?\nNo. Once a block is accepted onto the main chain, which is usually the addition of about 5 or 6 more blocks in bitcoin, your transaction is irreversible. The very concept of blockchain is that the ledger is immutable. This means that the root of merkle trees are also permanently stored in the ledger and cannot be modified.

Pure EdDSA using the ed25519 curve and SHA-512\n\nEdDSA is the current state of the art in mainstream cryptography. It implements elliptic curve cryptography with deterministic signatures, a fast implementation, explained constants, side channel resistance and many other\ndesirable characteristics. However, it is relatively new and not widely supported. For example, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use it in TLS yet (a draft RFC exists but is not standardised yet).\n\nThis is the default signature scheme for the node's well-known and confidential identities, and for the network bootstrapper.\n\n2. ECDSA using the NIST P-256 curve (secp256r1) and SHA-256\n\nThis is the default choice for most systems that support elliptic curve cryptography today and is recommended by NIST. It is also supported by the majority of the HSM vendors.\n\nThis is the default signature scheme for the root network certificate authority, the doorman, the node certificate authority (which issues the node's identity and TLS keys), the node's TLS keys, and the network map on the Corda Network.\n\n3. ECDSA using the Koblitz k1 curve (secp256k1) and SHA-256\n\nsecp256k1 is the curve adopted by Bitcoin and as such there is a wealth of infrastructure, code and advanced algorithms designed for use with it. This curve is standardised by NIST as part of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuite B\u00e2\u0080\u009d cryptographic algorithms and as such is more widely supported than ed25519. By supporting it, Corda gains access to the ecosystem of advanced cryptographic techniques and devices pioneered by the Bitcoin community.\n\n4. RSA (3072bit) PKCS#1 and SHA-256\n\nRSA is well supported by any sort of hardware or software as a signature algorithm no matter how old. For example, legacy HSMs will support this, as will obsolete operating systems. RSA is using bigger keys than ECDSA and thus it is recommended for inclusion only for its backwards compatibility properties, and only for usage where legacy constraints or government regulation forbids the usage of more modern approaches.\n\n5. SPHINCS-256 and SHA-512 (experimental)\n\nSPHINCS-256 is a post-quantum secure algorithm that relies only on hash functions. It is included as a hedge against the possibility of a malicious adversary obtaining a quantum computer capable of running Shor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s algorithm in future. SPHINCS is based ultimately on a clever usage of Merkle hash trees. Hash functions are a very heavily studied and well understood area of cryptography. Thus, it is assumed that there is a much lower chance of breakthrough attacks on the underlying mathematical problems. However, compared to the EdDSA, ECDSA and RSA algorithms, SPHINCS uses relatively big public keys, it is slower, and it outputs bigger signatures.","199":"So the solution I came up is to downgrade node to v8.12.0 and it works.","200":"Is the identity transaction processor, identity-tp running on all nodes?\n\nA quote from:\nhttps:\/\/sawtooth.hyperledger.org\/docs\/core\/releases\/latest\/cli\/identity-tp.html\n\n\n  This process is required to apply any changes to on-chain permissions\n  used by the Sawtooth platform.\n\n\nThere is also an active chat forum for Sawtooth at https:\/\/chat.hyperledger.org\/channel\/sawtooth","201":"To be precise, it allows cross-org mutual discovery of peers, and therefore it is crucial for cross org endorsements if the client uses service discovery.\nThis has nothing to do with chaincodes... chaincodes are installed independently to channels.\nYes.

As the block variables are obviously shared within the same block, you can easily use internal messages to yield the same outcome.\nOther methods are like using blockhash of current or some past block\nor blockhash of a past block combined with a private seed. block.blockhash(block.number) function is used in these cases. However, at the moment of transaction execution in the EVM, the blockhash of the block that is being created is not yet known for obvious reasons and the EVM will always yield zero. If we are trying it with the blockhash of a previous block, an attacker can make an exploit contract with the same code in order to call the target contract via an internal message. The \u00e2\u0080\u009crandom\u00e2\u0080\u009d numbers for the two contracts will be the same.\nEven if we combine the blockhash with a private seed, being transparent in nature, the blockchain must not be used to store secrets in plaintext. It is trivial to extract the value of the private variable pointer from the contract storage and supply it as an argument to an exploit.\nSome Areas Worth Exploring\n\nExternal oracles\nSignidice\nCommit\u00e2\u0080\u0093reveal approach\n\nWith External oracles like Oraclize, smart contracts can request data from web APIs such as currency exchange rates, weather forecasts, and stock prices (like random.org). The key drawback of this approach is that it is centralized. Will Oraclize daemon tamper with the results? Can we trust random.org?\nInstead of Oraclize, we can also use BTCRelay which is a bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains. Using BTCRelay, smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain can request future Bitcoin blockhashes and use them as a source of entropy.\nSignidice is an algorithm based on cryptographic signatures that can be used for random number generation in smart contracts involving only two parties: the player and the house. The algorithm works as follows:\n\nThe player makes a bet by calling a smart contract.\nThe house sees the bet, signs it with its private key, and sends the signature to the smart contract.\nThe smart contract verifies the signature using the known public key.\nThis signature is then used to generate a random number.\n\nCommit\u00e2\u0080\u0093reveal approach consists of two phases:\n\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommit\u00e2\u0080\u009d stage, when the parties submit their cryptographically protected secrets to the smart contract.\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009creveal\u00e2\u0080\u009d stage, when the parties announce cleartext seeds, the smart contract verifies that they are correct, and the seeds are used to generate a random number.\n\nA better implementation of the commit\u00e2\u0080\u0093reveal approach is Randao. Commit\u00e2\u0080\u0093reveal can be combined with future blockhashes to make it more secure.\nThis pretty much covers all the methods for random number generation using Ethereum.","216":"Though there are limited information shows above, the peer log give the essential hint about the problem:\n\nWARN 044 channel [mychannel]: MSP error: the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of \"x509: ECDSA verification failure\" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate \"ca.org1.example.com\" \n\n\nHere is the suggestions that may help your to solve this problem:\n\n\nChange your peer's logging level to DEBUG on docker-compose file, you will be more easily to find the solution followed by the debug information.\nMake sure your CA container is running and its logs not throws out error, like some certifications verify error, which commonly causes by wrong configuration. \nNow that the logs shows up some information about x509 ECDSA, which related to the signature and and the peers endorsement keycert.

There are tons of good blogs present on internet for you to explore.  Let me try to provide you a brief summary with my limited knowledge of distributed ledgers.\n\nBlockchain is actually theoretically tamperproof (Someone can still make a 51% attack on blockchain, but that would require huge computational power)\n\nWhy is it so? Two reasons :\n\nA cryptographic fingerprint unique to each block\n\nconsensus protocol, the process by which the nodes in the network agree on a shared history.\n\nThe fingerprint, called a hash, takes a lot of computing time and energy to generate initially(This time and energy increases or decreases depending upon the total computing power present with the miners). It thus serves as a proof that the miner who added the block to the blockchain did the computational work to earn a bitcoin reward (for this reason, Bitcoin is said to use a \u00e2\u0080\u009cproof-of-work\u00e2\u0080\u009d protocol). This hash is just a merkle hash of all the transactions included in this block. It also serves as a kind of seal, since altering the block would require generating a new hash. Verifying whether or not the hash matches its block, however, is easy, and once the nodes have done so they update their respective copies of the blockchain with the new block. This is the consensus protocol.\n\nThe final security element is that the hashes also serve as the links in the blockchain: each block includes the previous block\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique hash. So if you want to change an entry in the ledger retroactively, you have to calculate a new hash not only for the block it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in but also for every subsequent block. And you have to do this faster than the other nodes can add new blocks to the chain (On an average a new block is added every 10 minutes). So unless you have computers that are more powerful than the rest of the nodes combined (and even then, success isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guaranteed), all the alterations needs to be done in 10 minutes window, any blocks you add will conflict with existing ones, and the other nodes will automatically reject your alterations. This is what makes the blockchain tamperproof, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmutable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat would happen if you deploy your own blockchain with proof of work?\nIt really depends how many blocks are already present on your blockchain and difficulty of your proof of work algorithm. If complexity is low and few miners are competing for the next block, anybody with more computational power with all the miners combined can make their own valid fork,  with transactions suited to their needs. \n\nI want to manipulate a transaction at n-10th block?\n\nlets say the number of blocks in Bitcoin blockchain as of this instant is n,  and you want to alter a transaction at  n-10th block, thats is 10 blocks back in time. \n\nMiners will compete to put the next block n+1 th block, the time frame for which is approximately 10 minutes, you can also compete but for you to win you must have computational power as compared to miners which is around  51200544 TH\/s.\nProbabilistically speaking if you have 1TH\/s mining power, your chance of solving a block is 1\/ 51200544, Lets say the hardware to calculate 1TH\/s costs around  1000$, just calculate the cost to have an idea .\n\nAs already mentioned, Every block has a merkle hash included in the header which is turn depends upon every transaction included in the block and a difficulty which needs to be solved (The stuff miners calculate). This merkle root is included in the header of next block.\n\nso if you want to change a transaction or multiple transactions at n-10th block, You need to do two things for n-10th block.\n1. Calculate the merkle root again as transactions have changed.\n2. Solve the difficulty.\n\nSince the merkle root has changed, you need to solve the difficulty of every block following this block till this very time instant, to make it a valid branch.\n\nThe time frame to do all this is just 10 minutes, because in next 10 minutes , another block will be pushed by miners in the chain.","218":"In order for private data collections to work, you need to set up cross-organization gossip.

Each of these models makes some guarantees about the length of time (\u00e2\u0080\u009clatency\u00e2\u0080\u009d) that can occur between the exchange of messages amongst nodes in a given round of the protocol execution. This categorization is important because in the distributed setting a single node cannot distinguish between a peer node that has failed and a peer node that is just taking a long time to respond. \n\nIn the synchronous model, there is some maximum value (\u00e2\u0080\u009cupper bound\u00e2\u0080\u009d) T on the time between when a node sends a message and when you can be certain that the receiving node hears the message. You also have an upper bound P on the relative difference in speed between nodes (so you can account for machines with slow processors). \n\nIn the asynchronous model, we remove both upper bounds T and P. Messages can take arbitrarily long to reach peers and each node can take an arbitrary amount of time to respond. When we say arbitrary, we include \u00e2\u0080\u009cinfinity\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning that it takes forever for some event to occur. \n\nThe partially synchronous model in a mix of the two: upper bounds exist for T and P but the protocol designer does not know them and the task is designing mechanisms that still come to consensus in light of this fact. In practice, protocol implementers can achieve systems resembling this model given the realistic characteristics of modern networks\/machines (messages usually get where they are going) and use of tactics like timeouts to indicate when a node should retry sending a message.\n\nKeeping in mind the above facts, Both Paxos and Raft belongs to the partial synchronous models. \n\nThe Byzantine Generals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Problem is a classic problem faced by any distributed computer system network. Aim is to maintain same state on all participant nodes in presence of malicious nodes.\n\nIn distributed systems, there a collection of hard problems that you constantly need to deal with.\n\n Things fail. You can never count on anything being reliable. Even if you have\n perfectly bug-free software, and hardware that never breaks, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve still got \n to deal with the fact that network connections can break, or messages within a \n network can get lost, or that some bozo might sever your network connection\n with a bulldozer. (That really happened while I was at Google!)\n\n Given (1), you can never rely on one copy of anything, because that copy might \n become unavailable due to a failure. So you need to keep multiple copies, and\n those copies need to be consistent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 meaning that at any time, all of the\n copies agree about their contents.\n\n There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to maintain a single completely consistent view of time between\n multiple computers. Due to inconsistencies in individual machine performance,\n and variable network delays, variable storage latency, and several other\n factors, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no canonical way of saying that for two events X and Y, \u00e2\u0080\u009cX\n happened before Y\u00e2\u0080\u009d. What that means is that when you try to maintain a consistent set of data, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just say \u00e2\u0080\u009cRun all of the events in order\u00e2\u0080\u009d, because while one server maintaining one copy might \u00e2\u0080\u009cknow\u00e2\u0080\u009d that X happened before Y, another server maintaining another copy might be just as certain that Y happened before X.\n\n\nIn short, everything can fail at any time; after failure, participants can recover and rejoin the system; any no part of the system acts in an actively adversarial way(byzantine failures may be because of malware).\n\nTo solve this problem we have consensus algorithm with the aim to make all participants to agree on the same state.\nConsensus involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a decision on a value, that decision is final. Typical consensus algorithms make progress when any majority of their servers is available.\nPaxos and Raft are consensus algorithms which solves byzantine general problem in distributed networks public or private.","262":null,"263":"After going through a lot of articles, websites, I didn't find anything helpful.

What about the\n  consensus algorithms? (e.g. something like PoW, PoS, PoET)\n\n\nThe consensus is done on the order of the transactions and not on their content.\nThe endorsement policy, dictates whether a transaction is seen as valid or not by the network. \n\n\n  This paper seems to suggest that the orderer nodes are also involved\n  in Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). However, my understanding of\n  orderer nodes is that they are only responsible for ordering the\n  endorsed transactions and broadcast them to all the peer nodes\n\n\nRight, that's correct - The current Fabric implementation has no BFT orderer.

What is the default consensus algorithm and how\n  does it fit into the picture of the Peer section as described from the\n  official website?\n\n\nIt verifies them via 2 ways:\n\n\nEndorsement policy - each transaction has a target to one or more chaincodes (namespaces in the DB). Each such namespace has an chaincode has its own endorsement policy. If the transaction is signed by peers such that the endorsement policy is satisifed, then the transaction is deemed as one that passed the endorsement policy.\nMVCC(Multi version concurrency control) - A transaction that read keys during its execution, records their versions, and then upon commit the peer checks that the versions didn't change, so the causality of the data still remains intact.","266":"You have accidentally stumbled upon one of ethereum's lesser known \"features\".

That's a net cost of -10,000, so the total for the two store instructions is -5,000.\n\nThe difference between 25,000 and -5,000 is 30,000, which is precisely the gas difference between the two transactions.","279":"An anchoring transaction is a regular Bitcoin transaction.

After checked some related issues and docs, the temporary solutions for me is restart the peer which you found Failed to invoke chaincode name \"qscc\" at its log:\ndocker restart <peer container's id>\n\nHowever, this solution cannot solve the problem completely. But you can check this issues to get more information( the issues is duplicated by this and it's still unresolved).\nHere is a related comment by Manish Sethi for explaing what happends behind querying ledger:\n\nLedger exposes two set of APIs one set of APIs relate to state reads and manipulation and the other set of APIs relate to querying the blockchain status (such as GetBlockByNumber and GetTransactionByID). The first set of APIs are exposed via transaction simulator and (are meant for a chaincode to use during transaction simulation) and the second set of API are exposed as a direct APIs in the ledger interface (and are meant for clients to know the ledger status).\nKeeping the above in mind, a tacit assumption in the ledger design has been that a single gorouting limits it's usage to one of the above set of APIs exclusively. A chaincode limits itself to state related APIs and a ledger status querying client would not need to create a simulator.\nHowever, on the higher layers, since the ledger status related APIs are exposed via chaincode (qscc, to be specific), the above assumption is broken. The execution path for answering the ledger status queries obtains a transaction simulator before it reaches the qscc code (which has no use in fact, of the transaction simulator).\nMore specifically, an additional constraint on these two sets of APIs relates to the fact that two independent external calls to any of the ledger API should give a perceived notion of atomic commit to the block storage and the state. For instance, this should not happen that a client queries the API GetBlockchainInfo and finds out that block number 10 is committed but when he submits a subsequent state query, the query returns the state as of block 9 (because, the state update for block 10 are still pending). This is implemented by a pair of locks One lock syncs the state between simulation and statedb commit and another syncs the ledger status related calls with the overall commit. This is done for achieving better performance by halting the simulation to a minimum (only when the updates are actually been dumped to the disk) at the cost of ledger status related queries. Because, the qscc takes a transaction simulator, the above mentioned interaction leads to the reported deadlock. I believe that going forward, one of the suggestions was to expose these ledger status related APIs via grpc interface which will fix this issue. However, I list below three options for completeness...\nqscc path not to take hold of a transaction simulator (which is desired otherwise also, as the transaction simulator is an expensive resource as it takes a read lock on the statedb to sync with commit and hence should be taken only for transaction simulations).\nAn alternate fix could be to implement the above mentioned perceived notion of atomic commit to the block storage and the state by a coarser level single lock but that will impact the throughput an not a desired solution.\nImplement the perceived notion of atomic commit yet differently.. which requires some significant work in the interaction between ledger storage and the statedb. In nut shell, exposing the ledger storage a two phase commit. In first step, we append the block and then in the second step, update the BlockchainInfo and blockindexes sunchronized with statedb updates.\nGiven, the above, since the first one is anyway desired, my suggestion would be fix that for 1.1 and 1.2.","282":"sudo npm install\u00c2\u00a0 -g ethereumjs-testrpc\nYou have to run this command as superuser otherwise it won't run . because it's trying to accessed your filesystem.","283":"Take a look at the Corda Samples page.

The lookup tool you use should have a mechanism to set the sender.\n\nCall vs Transaction\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the difference between a call and a transaction.\n\nIt appears you're running a call, which runs quickly and does not alter the state of the blockchain. msg.sender is set in both a transaction and a call. In a transaction, it cannot be faked: you must have the private key associated with the given account. But in a call, you are free to set the sender to any value you like.\n\nSetting the Sender\n\nHow you set the sender depends on what tool you are using to call. That tool might be web3.js, web3.py, Mist, MyEtherWallet, MyCrypto, etc. They all have (or might not have!) a mechanism to set the sender in a call.\n\nMyEtherWallet\n\nIn the comments, you mention MyEtherWallet specifically. In a quick search, I didn't find anything about how to set the sender. There is this unanswered question on ethereum.stackexchange that seems worth following, since it is asking roughly the same question: How to check msg.sender balance with MyEtherWallet contract\n\nContract Workarounds\n\n\n  is it possible to specify such settings for the contract?\n\n\nThere is no way to help someone set the sender from inside the contract. But you can supply a different method that takes an address as an argument. Then tools like MyEtherWallet will allow you to set the address of interest. For example:\n\nfunction getLink(address account) public view returns(string){\n    if(tokenBalances[account] > 0){\n        return link;\n    }else{\n        return \"You need to purchase a token at first...\";\n    }\n}\n\n\nHiding Data\n\nIt's worth noting that hiding data by checking msg.sender is useless. Anyone can set a fake sender in a call (or directly inspect blockchain state). So, it's trivial to bypass this \"protection.\"","321":"You need to use this api: \n\nhttps:\/\/blockchain.info\/address\/$hash_160?format=json\n\n\nit will provide you with a list of the latest transactions.","322":"I think your code could be a lot simpler (not sure you need additional functions you wrote etc) - but here is an example below - you can translate to your environment (I don't have your model).

This is a case of you trying to build a better mousetrap. \n\nHonestly, your hashing algorithm is very inefficient. The entire point of a hash is to be a fast, low-overhead way of quickly getting a \"unique\" (as unique as possible) integer to represent any object to avoid comparing by values.\n\nUsing that as a premise, if you start doing any type of intense computation in a hash algorithm, it is already counter-productive. Once you start implementing modulo and pow functions, it is inefficient.\n\nUsually best practice involves taking a value(s) of the object that can be represented as integers, and performing bit operations on them, typically with prime numbers to help reduce hash collisions.\n\ndef hash\n  h = value1 ^ 393\n  h += value2 ^ 17\n  h\nend\n\n\nIn your example, you are for some reason forcing the hash to the max value of a 16-bit unsigned integer, when typically 32-bits is used, although if you are comparing on the Ruby-side, this would be 31-bits due to how Ruby masks Fixnum values. Fixnum was deprecated on the Ruby side as it should have been, but internally the same threshold exists between what how a Bignum and Fixnum are handled. The Integer class simply provides one interface on the Ruby side, as those two really should never have been exposed outside of the C code.\n\nIn your specific example using strings, I would simply symbolize them. This guarantees a quick and efficient way that determines if two strings are equal without hardly any overhead, and comparing 2 symbols is the exact same as comparing 2 integers. There is a caveat to this method if you are comparing a vast number of strings. Once a symbol is created, it is alive for the life of the program. Any additional strings that equal to it will return the same symbol, but you cannot remove the memory of the symbol (just a few bytes) for as long as the program runs.

Use Fabric's inbuilt logger. Fabric provides logging mechanism as follows:\n\nFor Golang: https:\/\/godoc.org\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/core\/chaincode\/shim#ChaincodeLogger \n\nFor NodeJS: https:\/\/fabric-shim.github.io\/Shim.html#.newLogger__anchor \n\nFor Java: You can use any standard logging framework like Log4J\n\n\nAvoid using Global Keys - Hyperledger Fabric uses an Optimistic Locking Model while committing transactions. In the two-stage process of endorsement & committment, if some versions of the keys that you had read in the Endorsement has changed till your transactions reach the committing stage, you get an MVCC_READ_CONFLICT error. This often is a probability when one or more concurrent transactions are updating the same key.\nUse Couch DB Queries wisely\n\n\nCouch DB Queries DO NOT alter the READ SET of a transaction - \nMongo Queries are for querying the Key Value store aka StateDB only. It does not alter the read set of a transaction. This might lead to phantom reads in the transaction.\nOnly the DATA that you have stored in the couchDB is searchable - Do not be tempted to search for a key by its name using the MangoQuery. Although you can access the Fauxton console of the CouchDB, you cannot access a key by querying a key by which it is stored in the database. Example : Querying by channelName\\0000KeyName is not allowed. It is better to store your key as a property in your data itself.\n\nWrite Deterministic Chaincode - Never write chaincode that is not deterministic. It means that if I execute the chaincode in 2 or more different environments at different times, result should always be the same, like setting the value as the current time or setting a random number. For example: Avoid statements like calling rand.New(...) , t := time.Now() or even relying on a global variable (check ) that is not persisted to the ledger.\nThis is because, that if the read write sets generated are not the same, the Validation System chaincode might reject it and throw an ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE.\nBe cautions when calling Other Chaincodes from your chaincode. - Invoking a chaincode from another is okay when both chaincodes are on the same channel. But be aware that if it is on the other channel then you get only what the chaincode function returns (only if the current invoker has rights to access data on that channel). NO data will be committed in the other channel, even if it attempts to write some. Currently, cross channel chaincode chaincode invocation does not alter data (change writesets) on the other channel. So, it is only possible to write to one channel at a time per transaction.\nRemember to Set Chaincode Execution Timeout - Often it might so happen that during high load your chaincode might not complete its execution under 30s. It is a good practice to custom set your timeout as per your needs. This is goverened by the parameter in the core.yaml of the peer. You can override it by setting the environment variable in your docker compose file :\nExample: CORE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTETIMEOUT=60s\nRefrain from Accessing External Resources - Accessing external resources (http) might expose vulnerability and security threats to your chaincode. You do not want malicous code from external sources to influence your chaincode logic in any way. So keep away from external calls as much as possible.","375":"Errors like the one in question most commonly show up because of installing gRPC on one platform\/architecture\/Node version, and then using it on a different one.

You also don't specify the version of Hyperledger Composer you tried to use so I the answer here is specific to Composer 0.19.x which is the current release at time of writing.\n\nHyperledger composer is a framework that makes use of the DLT capabilities of hyperledger fabric. As such any business network is managed and controlled via the mechanisms of hyperledger fabric. So to install\/start\/upgrade a business network requires the appropriate Hyperledger Fabric permissions to perform chaincode install\/instantiate\/upgrade. In order to interact with a business network you need an identity that is authorised by hyperledger fabric to do so.\n\nIn Composer there is no such thing as a network administrator (ie a single participant or set of participants that have overall authority). All access for ANY participant is controlled by the acl definitions that a defined by the business network. The ability to change the business network (and thus the acls) are controlled by the identity who is allowed to perform a hyperledger fabric chaincode upgrade (or start if doing first deployment).\n\nComposer provides a very simple hyperledger fabric setup for development purposes only as well as a sample ACL that grants a predefined participant type of NetworkAdmin (perhaps this built in default name is confusing as it isn't anything special) allowing it full access to everything. Also in all the tutorials everything is referred to admin and setup that way in order to provide an easy entry into developing business network applications and certainly isn't a guide or representation of how a production network should be set up.\n\nIn conclusion, hyperledger composer is bound by whatever capabilities hyperledger fabric has for access (and note that more capabilities to hyperledger fabric are being introduced such as zero knowledge proof). Composer then adds on to this it's own concept of access control governed by the ACL definition, using all of these capabilities you have complete control over what identities and participants can do and see within a hyperledger fabric ledger.","380":"I believe you forgot to specify your HttpProvider for your web3, thus you're not connecting to live Rinkeby network, and by default web3 is running on you local host, which is why even if you provide the right contract address, there's nothing there.\n\nTo connect to live network, I would strongly encourage you to use Infura Node by ConsenSys.\n\n\n\nconst Web3 = require(\"web3\");\nconst web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(\"https:\/\/rinkeby.infura.io\"));\n\n\n\n\nThen by now, everything should work perfectly fine.","381":"I expect the difference is simply related to your error handling code in your chaincode.

Also, the longest chain is always accepted as the valid chain. \n\nThere is absolutely no criteria or organisation that overlooks mining, meaning anybody can become a miner and start contributing. So the network is for the people, by the people, anybody can join and both submit as well as process transactions.\n\nIf the transaction is valid, that is you own the coin and are not double spending it, it will be processed by a miner. And if the block produced by the miner is accepted, so is your transaction.\n\nPrivate\/Permissioned\n\nOn the other hand, in case of private\/permissioned blockchain's like hyperledger fabric for example, participation and block processing is decided by a single or multiple organisations. Hence in this case, a block is processed only if it produced by a valid member and it is endorsed by nodes of all participating organizations.","502":"The general approach to connecting off-chain data stores is storing a hash reference to the data item in the NoSQL DB in a blockchain transaction (in addition to the NoSQL ID or something like that). That ensures integrity of the off-chain data. In future transactions you might update that hash reference to correspond to an updated version of the NoSQL data.\n\nAn example of a more integrated approach is for example BigchainDB. BigchainDB runs a Tendermint-based blockchain and a MongoDB instance in parallel.","503":"Since, as you know, stored data will not travel with a new contract and copying over data to a new contract would be expensive task after a few uses...your best bet is to separate functionality from data storage.\n\nCreate a contract with some basic setters and getters that only deals with data storage (from a particular contract address if necessary)...then create your main functional contract that connects to the data contract.","504":"Please use truffle Ganache ethereum client.\nDownload from \nhttp:\/\/truffleframework.com\/ganache\/\n\nI have created NodeJS code to read transaction from latest block.\nStep 1: Install nodeJS and NPM if not installed in your machine.\nStep 2: Create new folder \"demo\" and create new package.json file.

You need to increase your total supply and\/or lower your rate.\nSecond, only token owners can do a transfer unless an approve has been done first. When you deploy the token contract, all of the tokens are owned by msg.sender. However, when someone makes a purchase through your crowdsale contract, the request to do the transfer is coming from the address of the crowdsale contract, not the token owner when your token contract was deployed.

You have to mark the function as payable and you're transferring the entire balance of the contract, not what you are sending. When you send ether to a payable function, the ether is owned by the contract. From there, you can then send it (or a different amount) to another address. If you're trying to send exactly what is sent from your client to the address parameter, you should do the following:\n\nfunction sendMoney(address _sendToThisAddress) public payable {\n    _sendToThisAddress.transfer(msg.value);\n}","557":"I'm not a lawyer, but yes, I believe you are in general correct. \"Smart contracts\" in the Ethereum sense don't replace legal contracts, at least not in any jurisdiction I'm aware of, as a purely legal issue. If you want to contract with someone, you're still going to want to go to a real meatspace lawyer and sign a real meatspace contract.\n\nFrom a purely technical perspective, even if you were to try and define a meatspace contract solely in terms of an Ethereum contract, you would run into the difficulty that an Ethereum contract can only act on information that is on the blockchain. For a simple example, let's say you wanted to enter the simplest possible flood insurance contract, where you pay some amount up front, and if there is a flood anywhere in your ZIP code in the next 10 years, you can make a claim and get $x. This leaves aside all the messy details of what exactly got damaged and so on, but we still need some means to determine if there was a flood or not.\n\nYou might say \"But that's easy! Surely the government publishes such data, and we can simple specify in the contract that we believe the government's data and no-one else's.\" OK, so the government does publish the data, but they don't publish it on the Ethereum block chain.\n\n\"Oh, well we can just publish the data to the blockchain. Easy!\" Who's \"we\"? Whoever you trust to publish the government data can essentially settle your bet any way they want. The insurance company isn't going to let it be you, because you can just publish a \"yes, there's a flood\" message immediately and get free money. Likewise, you don't want to trust them to do it, because if there ever is a flood, they can essentially just deny your claim in the same way.\n\nSo, you'll need a third party \"oracle\", as they are known. There are various strategies here that involve multiple oracles and different incentive structures that try to get these oracles to play nice, or at least in the way you and the insurance company want them to. Fundamentally though, you've just reinvented the court system, or perhaps arbitration: If you and the insurance company ever disagree about something, you will have no recourse other than to plead your case to the oracles, and ask them to rule in your favor.\n\nNow, we've already established that both you and the insurance company trust the government (NOAA or whoever) to make this call. If that's the case, you've already chosen an oracle: the government. If you can somehow convince NOAA to issue their reports directly to the blockchain, or even with some kind of private-key signature that can be verified on the blockchain, then you've solved the problem. In the real world, almost no trusted \"oracles\" like government agencies do this, at least not yet.","558":"Thanks Clyde. This appears to be a bug.

A block can also have one or more transactions. Each transaction contains a read-write set which modifies one or more key\/value pairs (Asset values).\nNodes are the communication entities of the blockchain. A \u00e2\u0080\u009cnode\u00e2\u0080\u009d is only a logical function in the sense that multiple nodes of different types can run on the same physical server. What counts is how nodes are grouped in \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrust domains\u00e2\u0080\u009d and associated to logical entities that control them.\n\n\nThere are three types of nodes:\n\n\nClient or submitting-client: a client that submits an actual transaction-invocation to the endorsers, and broadcasts transaction-proposals to the ordering service.\nPeer: a node that commits transactions and maintains the state and a copy of the ledger. Besides, peers can have a special endorser role.\nOrdering-service-node or orderer: a node running the communication service that implements a delivery guarantee, such as atomic or total order broadcast..\n\n\nThe term mining \/ miners is referred in Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin. In Public Blockchain Networks, an end-user submits a transaction, which is verified (endorsed as authentic transaction) by majority of the nodes participating in the network. Specifically for Bitcoin network, all the nodes in the network compete to verify all the incoming transactions (termed as Proof-Of-Work) and the winning node is rewarded with an increase of balance in their crypto-wallets. This concept is called Mining. \n\nHowever, in private or permissioned blockchains (such as Hyperledger), There's no Mining or Proof-Of-Work. Instead all the nodes participating in the network come to a state of agreement that a specific transaction is valid or invalid (termed as Consensus).\n\n\n  When an end user initiate transaction who is the first component in blockchain who receives this request and this node forwards to whom and how ?\n\n\nThe answer depends on the underlying blockchain platform being used. For Hyperledger Fabric, Who will receive the request is decided by the endorsement policy as which and how many participating nodes are required to verify the transaction. For example, if the endorsement policy states that each peer from each organization should endorse a transaction, the request will be received by all the peers participating in the network. The peers validate the transaction and replies with an endorsement response containing the endorser signatures and the read\/write sets of that transaction. When the client receives the endorsement response, it assembles the endorsements into a transaction and submits it to the ordering service node, which orders the transactions chronologically into blocks and deliver these blocks to all the peers in the network.\n\nFor Hyperledger Fabric, you can see the detailed and self explanatory Transaction Flow Here.","585":"That's a very generic Remix error message.

Hyperledger Fabric's consensus can be treated as a special case of the same, may be a power-packed one. It kind of checks the transaction during multiple phases to ensure the permission, order and correctness of changes which are getting written to ledger.\n\nIn Fabric, when you are executing a transaction, if not in error, you would want this transaction to commit to the ledger, ie, to write the transaction into a block in the ledger in the right order. And then the same to be consistently synchronized across all participants in the network, through a collaborative process. So this process which ensures correctness in order and data synchronization - is called consensus\n\nHLF Standard definition is \n\n\n  The process of keeping the ledger transactions synchronized across the network \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to ensure that ledgers update only when transactions are approved by the appropriate participants, and that when ledgers do update, they update with the same transactions in the same order \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is called consensus\n\n\nThis is done across the entire transaction cycle in the following ways\n\n\nWhen you are submitting the transactions, i.e, when you invoke a function in the smart contract, the Client SDK which you are using has to send that transaction proposal to the endorsers ( specific to that smart contract in the specific channel ) This transaction proposal is takes the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cryptographic credentials to produce a unique signature\nEndorsing peers do their share of checks, like proposal is valid, user who has attempted the transaction has the privilege for the same in that channel etc  . And then they would simulate the transaction - and creates a response and R\/W set. This is sent as proposal response which comes back to SDK.\nSDK accumulates them and checks them and then sends them out to the orderer. Orderer will order the transaction as per time and creates a block and sends the block out to all the peers in the relevant channel\nPeers who receive the block starts inspecting each transaction in the block (using Validation System Chaincode), to see endorsement is done for all of them & r\/w set is proper ( MVCC check). Depending on the checks, the transactions may be marked valid or invalid\n\n\nSo once all the checks are ok, the transaction is marked valid and current state is updated, and finally the blocks is written and events are generated accordingly. This way the consensus is accomplished over multiple stages in Hyperledger fabric. I think you would understand better if you refer to this link below Hyperledger Fabric Transaction Flow","601":"Decentralized\n\nIt means that there is no central storage.

Netting and delivery-versus-payment\/atomic asset swaps can be achieved without the need for a centralised party. Corda also removes the need for reconciliation, which happens automatically via the platform.\n\nMore importantly, Corda is driving towards a vision of global interoperability. See \nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/corda\/universal-interoperability-why-enterprise-blockchain-applications-should-be-deployed-to-shared-3d4daff97754. In this vision, assets are not trapped in silos, and can move freely across the network. For example:\n\n\nBankNode receives cash via the interbank payment system\nBankNode lends this money to SupplierNode in exchange for an obligation\nSupplierNode uses this money to purchase goods from FactoryNode\nFactoryNode uses the money to pay the suppliers of its raw materials\nAnd so on, and so on...\n\n\nCoordinating things using a clearing house remains possible when looking at a single area like interbank payments. However, as the network grows to support many different business use-cases - supply chain, lending, assets, payments... - it becomes increasingly difficult to find a coordinating party that can be trusted by all parties, across industries and regions. Corda removes the need to identify such a coordinating party.\n\nIn this vision, central banks are likely to continue to exist as trusted issuers of fiat currency.","603":"The concept of \"org\" is not restricted to independent companies.

While the former is a hash algorithm, the latter is a pseudo random generation algorithm (that uses SHA1 to update its internal state, of course.) One trivial result of this difference is, SHA1 outputs a fixed size of bits, where SHA1PRNG outputs as many bits as you like.\nBecause of this difference, SHA3-512 cannot be used as PRNG directly, although it is available in Java. What you need to do is, implement a PRNG algorithm using SHA3-512 (this part is really tricky, since generating a pseudo random stream is quite difficult.) and register it through your custom Security Provider (like Bouncy Castle does) with some name MySHA3PRNG. After that, you can get an instance of it with name MySHA3PRNG as you do for SHA1PRNG.

Now we will go over how to configure an Ethereum node. Make sure you are in your home directory on your cloud server with the pwd command and then create a new folder called whatever you want to create the genesis block of your Ethereum blockchain. You can do this with the following commands. The first command is to create the folder, change directory into the folder and then create a file called genesis.json.\n\nmkdir mlg-ethchain cd mlg-ethchain nano genesis.json\n\nTo create a private blockchain you need to define the genesis block. Genesis blocks are usually embedded in the client but with Ethereum you are able to configure a genesis block using a json object. Paste the following JSON object into your genesis.json file and we explain each variable in the following section.\n\n\n\n{\n\"nonce\": \"0xdeadbeefdeadbeef\",\n\"timestamp\": \"0x0\",\n\"parentHash\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n\"extraData\": \"0x0\",\n\"gasLimit\": \"0x8000000\",\n\"difficulty\": \"0x400\",\n\"Mixhash\": \n\"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", \"coinbase\": \"0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333\",\n\"alloc\": {\n}\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe coinbase is the default address of the mining address. Because you have not created a wallet yet this can be set to whatever you want provided that it is a valid Ethereum address. Difficulty is how hard it is for a miner to create a new block. For testing and development purposes it is recommended that you start with a low difficulty and then increase it. The parentHash is the hash of the parent block which doesnt exist because this is the first block in the chain. The gasLimit is the maximum amount of gas that is required to execute a transaction or send tokens from one account to another. The nonce is a random number for this block. This is the number that every miner has to guess to define the block but for the first block it must be hardcoded. You are able to provide any extraData is the extraData section. In the alloc section you can allocate a number of premined tokens or ether to certain addresses at the beginning of the blockchain. We do not want to do this so we will keep it blank.\n\nAfter you have confirmed this you can check the file to make sure it has been configured correctly with the cat command. From the same directory input this command.\n\ncat genesis.json","655":"The yeoman generator is a bit limited, it doesn't generate those for you automatically.

If one of the two parties buys a faster machine, then they will compute the hash faster. That's just the way it is.\n\nHowever, there is something we can do. Bitcoin, for example, is based on SHA-256 (the 256 bit long version of SHA-2). SHA-2 is specifically designed to be fast, and to be easy to speed up by specialized hardware. And that is exactly what we see happen in the Bitcoin mining space with the move from pure software-based mining to CPUs with built-in acceleration for SHA-2 to GPUs to FPGAs to ASICs.\n\nThe reason for this is that SHA-2 is designed as a general cryptographic hash function, and one of the main usage of cryptographic hashes is as the basis for TLS\/SSL and digital signatures where large amounts of data need to be hashed in a short amount of time.\n\nBut, there are other use cases for cryptographic hash functions, in particular, password hashing. For password hashing, we want the hash function to be slow and hard to speed up, since a legitimate user only needs to hash a very small amount of data (the password) once (when logging in), whereas an attacker needs to hash large numbers of passwords over and over again, for a brute force attack.\n\nExamples for such hash functions are PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, Catena, Lyra2, yescrypt, Makwa, and Argon2 (the latter being the winner of the 2013 Password Hashing Competition). Scrypt in particular is designed to be hard to speed up using GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs as well as through space-time or time-space tradeoffs. Scrypt uses a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator to initialize a huge array of pseudo-random numbers in memory, and then uses another CSPRNG to generate indices for accesses into this array, thus making both the memory contents as well as the memory access patterns pseudo-random.\n\nTheoretically, of course, it would be possible to pre-compute the result, after all, accessing an array in some specific order is the same as accessing a much larger array in linear order, however, scrypt is designed in such a way that this pre-computed array would be prohibitively large. Plus, scrypt has a simple work-factor parameter that can be used to exponentially increase the size of this array, if memory capacity increases. So, trading space for time is not possible.\n\nLikewise, it would be possible to create a PRNG which combines the two pseudo-random processes into one process and computes the results on the fly. However, scrypt is designed in such a way that the computing time for this would be prohibitively long, and again, there is the exponential work-factor which can be used to drastically increase the computing time without changes to the algorithm. So, trading time for space is not possible.\n\nThe pseudo-random access pattern to the memory also defeats any sort of branch-prediction, memory prefetching or caching scheme of the CPU.\n\nAnd lastly, since the large array is a shared global mutable state, and there is no way to sensibly divide the work into independent units, the algorithm is not sensibly parallelizable, which means you can't speed it up using GPUs.\n\nAnd in fact, some newer cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, blockchains etc. use an scrypt-based proof-of-work scheme.\n\nNote, however, that running scrypt on a faster machine is still faster than running scrypt on a slower machine. There is no way around that. It just means that we cannot get the ridiculous amounts of speedup we get from using specialized hardware for SHA-2, for example.

The reason is simple: Blockchain is a chain, so only one block can be mined after the current block. So all miners compete to collect transactions from the memory pool, and put them on a block, and find the nonce of that block (do the mining). When the number of miners increase (or the hashing power increases), the protocol automatically increases the difficulty of mining to keep the block-time constant.\n\nBut then why is it necessary to have all these miners? It's for security. It's to protect against 51% attacks. A blockchain arbitrary rule is that a longer chain is always the right one. So an attacker can mine the blockchain faster than everyone else to erase transactions that he confirmed before. This is why higher hashing power is higher security (but is a waste of energy, too, leading to the PoS\/PoW debates).\n\nWhat about scaling? The only scaling that can be done on the blockchain is either by making the block-time less (like Litecoin does, by making it 2.5 minutes instead of 10 mintues as Bitcoin), or by increasing the block-size (like Bitcoin Cash did), or by doing something smart and dynamic instead of these dumm solutions (my opinion here, and we have to respect that all the former is legacy technology anyway), and do it like Cryptonote\/Bytecoin\/Monero, which increases the blocksize dynamically based on the number of transactions in the last 100 blocks.","733":"Initial ether needs to be specified in genesis.json when you initialize your private blockchain.\n\nA simple example:\n\n{\n    \"config\": {\n        \"chainId\": 29462\n    },\n    \"difficulty\": \"0x400\",\n    \"gasLimit\": \"0x8000000\",\n    \"alloc\": {\n        \"d69cc234de15189f0ba998a41421961e89837fc5\": {\n            \"balance\": \"30000000000000000000000000000\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe address specified here needs to be created before initializing the genesis block.

No, data on a blockchain won't ever be deleted. A deletion is just another transaction saying certain data is deleted, so that the world state database (the DB with the non-deleted info) can remove that data. \n\nSince a blockchain is a Merkle Tree in the background (or maybe a Hashgraph...), it plays by those rules and is immutable. Data will always be there unless the ledger and transactions are removed from the machines, such as restarting the network and removing all the information from the peers. That's basically a wipe of every machine that was used for the network structure holding the ledger. For Bitcoin that's everyone, for permissioned blockchains that may only be a few machines and could reasonably happen. \n\nHowever, that's in theory, and it gets a little complicated with different implementations of a blockchain. It sounds like you're using Hyperledger Fabric, so let's take that as an example. If you're upgrading the Business Network Definition for your network dynamically and your asset definitions changed and won't support existing assets in the registry, are they actually deleted? I'm not sure, but I know they won't show up in a query, which might be effectively the same. Similarly, if you set an ACL rule or use encryption, then a marked asset might as well be deleted, since there will be many barriers (see the docs on Security and Access control) for a random participant to view that data. So depending on how sensitive your data is, it may not really matter.","743":"estimateGas will tell you exactly how much gas you need, but pretty much any tool you use to deploy will call that for you.

Right now 2 gwei looks good if you're not in a hurry.","744":"There are multiple assumptions\/concepts which may not be 100% true. I would request you to spend some more time on understanding how HLF works.\n\n\nSmart Contracts (read Chaincode for Hyperledger Fabric)are always public, at least to the admins or to the decision makers of all the parties involved in a contract. Generally Smart contracts are insulated from end users of each parties so it won't be as easy for an end users to access a chaincode. Also, in HLF, Chaincodes are built before deploying which could add one more layer of security. Now coming to your point, If you put private key on chaincode, It'll be exposed to all the participants of that contract (How widely, that depends on each party)\nBy Private keys, I assume that you're talking about the private keys of end users. Now this is up-to the end user or the org about where to store the keys. Hyperledger doesn't store any private\/public keys by-default. Again it's all about how you're managing your users for each orgs. \nYes, Chaincode can be run on limited numbers of the nodes and it has nothing to do with private keys (assuming these are users' private keys you're talking about)","745":"By default, the docs are at your localhost:3000\/explorer\n\nThis is generated automatically by the LoopBack framework.\n\nYou should carefully follow: https:\/\/hyperledger.github.io\/composer\/integrating\/getting-started-rest-api.html","746":"DISCLAIMER. This may not necessarily be an answer to your question. But I wanted to post it as an answer, as a comment does not allow me to express the below that easily.\n\nmutable struct Blockchain\n    chain::Array{Dict{String, Any}}\n    current_transactions::Array{String}\n    block::Dict{String, Any}\n    new_block::Function\n\n    function Blockchain(chain::Array{Dict{String, Any}}, current::Array{String})    \n        new(chain, current, new_block(previous_hash=1, proof=100)) \n        # ^issue calling function within the constructor here\n    end\nend\n\n\nHere, I assume that you are trying to add some member function functionality to your struct, as you have already stated that you are coming from a C++ background. However, this is not Julian. In Julia, as @crstnbr has already suggested, we need to define global functions that act on objects. The convention is that you add ! at the end of the function to indicate that the function will be changing at least one of its arguments.\n\nThen, by checking the definition of your new_block:\n\nfunction new_block(proof::String, previous_hash::String=nothing)\n    block = Dict(\n    \"index\" => length(chain) + 1, # which chain?\n    \"timestamp\" => time(),\n    \"transactions\" => current_transactions, # which current_transactions?\n    \"proof\" => proof,\n    \"previous_hash\" => previous_hash | hash(chain[end]), # which chain?\n    )\n    current_transactions = []\n    append!(chain, block) # which chain?\n    return block\nend\n\n\nI notice a couple of serious mistakes. First, there are some undefined variables that you try to use such as chain and current_transactions. I assume, again from C++, you have thought that new_block would be a member function of Blockchain, and hence, could see its chain member variable. This is not how Julia works. Second problem is how you try to call new_block:\n\nnew_block(previous_hash=1, proof=100)\n\n\nThis call is totally wrong. The above call notation relies on keyword arguments; however, your function definition only has positional arguments. To be able to support keyword arguments, you need to change your function definition to read as below:\n\nfunction new_block(; proof::String, previous_hash::String=nothing)\n  #                ^ note the semi-colon here\n  # ...\nend\n\n\nAnd last, you define proof and previous_hash to be of type String, but call them with 1, 100 and nothing, which are of type Int, Int and Void.\n\nI could not understand your design choice for the Blockchain application in your mind, but I strongly suggest that you should go step-by-step with simpler examples to learn the language. For instance, if you just try the below examples, you will understand how type annotations work in Julia:\n\nMain> f(s::String = nothing) = s\nf (generic function with 2 methods)\n\nMain> f()\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Void)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(::String) at none:1\n  f() at none:1\nStacktrace:\n [1] f() at .\/none:1\n [2] eval(::Module, ::Any) at .\/boot.jl:235\n\nMain> g(s::String) = s\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\nMain> g(100)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching g(::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  g(::String) at none:1\nStacktrace:\n [1] eval(::Module, ::Any) at .\/boot.jl:235\n\nMain> h1(var1 = 1, var2 = 100) = var1 + var2\nh1 (generic function with 3 methods)\n\nMain> h1(var2 = 5, var1 = 6)\nERROR: function h1 does not accept keyword arguments\nStacktrace:\n [1] kwfunc(::Any) at .\/boot.jl:237\n [2] eval(::Module, ::Any) at .\/boot.jl:235\n\n\nOne last comment is that as far as I can see from your example, you do not need mutable struct. struct should simply help you with your design --- you can still add to\/modify its chain, current_transactions and block variables. Check, again, the simpler example below:\n\nMain> struct MyType\n         a::Vector{Float64}\n       end\n\nMain> m = MyType([1,2,3]);\n\nMain> append!(m.a, 4);\n\nMain> m\nMyType([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n\n\nYou can think of MyType's a variable, in the above example, as being double * const a in C++ terms. You are not allowed to change a to point to a different memory location, but you can modify the memory location pointed-to by a.\n\nIn short, you should definitely try to learn the language from the official documentation step-by-step, and post questions here involving really minimal examples. Your example is convoluted in that sense.","747":"If you want to follow the tutorial as is, you need to address step 1 before moving on to step 2 (you can run the example with just Truffle, but the steps are different).

If eth.syncing returns false, your node isn't running properly (which is likely based on what you posted). If so, do the following:\n\n\nStop your node\nCompletely remove your blockchain data (\/home\/riyasoni\/.ethereum\/testnet in your case)\nUpgrade to the latest version of geth (you're running 1.7.3.

There's nothing wrong with the way your running geth, but personally I would not use the --bootnodes option and I would spend the time to run with --syncmode \"full\". Running in fast sync mode has limitations and your node will stop syncing entirely if you stop your node for some time and then try to restart. It will take time for your node to fully sync.\n\n\nAfter completing those steps, check the status of the node in the console again before moving on to Truffle.","748":"In bitcoin P2P network, once a block is mined, and propagated to peers (B, C, D), they validate it via several criteria, which include -\n\n\nchecking that the block's header is valid and has a hash of previous block on blockchain\nvalidate transactions inside the block\ncheck that the block was mined properly according to current difficulty rate\nand some more\n\n\nIf all those validations pass, then the block is added to B's, C's and D's local blockchain, and propagated immediately to their peers, so that it'll get added to their blockchain image as well.\n\nThis way, when a new block is mined, it propagates to the whole bitcoin network in few seconds.","749":"See https:\/\/github.com\/mahoney1\/composer-knowledge-wiki\/blob\/latest\/knowledge.md#information_source--blockchain-recap\nNot sure what the context of this question is - outnumbered by what ?

The path to take is going to depend on the complexity of the business logic you need to implement, the risk of the amount of money held in the contract, the frequency\/volume of the contracts between your parties, your operational budget, and your expected margins. To take some extreme examples, if I were in the business of putting a home buying escrow onto the blockchain, I would make each deal it's own contract (even though the terms of different deals may be similar). If I were building a lottery contract that executed every day, I would put a master contract for all lotteries on the blockchain. In another example, if I were to build a gambling business that supported multiple game types, I may have one master contract that tracks all activity and then delegates to a game specific contract.\n\nAll of that being said, I have faced similar situations in my own projects. I would usually start with individual contracts, but found this typically is not cost effective. Contract deployments are very expensive operations and most of my use cases were not like the \"buying a house\" example.

If you sign a transaction using private key of holder A, then you can simply call the transfer function on contract at contractAddress.

As such the standard function to call is transferFrom. Assuming that some sort of approval has been given from Holder A to Address C, and that myAddress refers to Address C, you can use the below transaction\n\n            var rawTransaction = {\n                \"from\": myAddress, \/\/ refers to Address C\n                \"nonce\": \"0x\" + lastCountOfTransaction.toString(16),\n                \"gasPrice\": web3.utils.toHex(1 * 1e9), \/\/1 can be changed to n gwei\n                \"gasLimit\": web3.utils.toHex(1000000), \/\/ 1000000 can be to set to any n number\n                \"to\": contractAddress,\n                \"value\": \"0x0\",\n                \"data\": ContractObject.methods.transferFrom(userAddressA, userAddressB, noOfTokens).encodeABI(),\n                \"chainId\": chainId\n            };\n\n\nThis is as far as ERC20 goes. Refer https:\/\/theethereum.wiki\/w\/index.php\/ERC20_Token_Standard for more info.\nWhat you are doing feels like minting, and ERC20 doesn't standardize that. \nWhat you can do here is that setup an owner of the contract and use a modifier like onlyOwner for a mint function in the contract.

You can also choose to keep an upper limit and make the tokens capped by introducing check in the mint function or by adding an additional modifier (like canMint) to it.

We could name it RLPx node discovery protocol.\n\nThe first time two peers meet each other they should perform a two-phase handshake (i.e. two different handshakes).\nIn the first handshake they exchange some cryptographic secrets (the details are explained here (in the rlpx specification)) that are used for the subsequent communications between them. The subsequent messages are therefore encrypted and authenticated.\n\nIn the second handshake they exchange their capabilities, i.e. which devp2p subprotocols they support (the peers can support multiple protocols). This second handshake could be considered already part of devp2p wire protocol (the Hello message). The documentation says that:\n\n\n  the \u00c3\u0090\u00ce\u009eVp2p nodes communicate by sending messages using RLPx\n\n\n(this time using TCP messages).\nI list some devp2p wire subprotocols that are widely used: \n\n\neth, the ethereum wire subprotocol used to exchange the information about the blockchain \nwhisper\nles the light ethereum subprotocol is the protocol designed for the light clients\n...If you want you can write your own subprotocol https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/go-ethereum\/wiki\/Peer-to-Peer.\n\n\nTherefore RLPx messages are encrypted and authenticated and on top of them you can communicate with different protocols.\nWe can say that RLPx is the transport layer protocol and devp2p and its subprotocols are the application level protocols.","770":null,"771":"Well there is no correction in the code.

The use of blender and luxrender is a deliberate move to get people using the system during the early development. More advanced uses can be expected as the system is developed.\n\nFrom the FAQ page -\n\n\n  Brass Golem is where we are at the moment with our MVP, in alpha testing now. This current version of Golem is only focused on rendering in Blender and LuxRender ... we consider CGI rendering to be one use case among many, and also a training ground.\n\n\nFrom the developers point of view, rendering animations consumes large cpu resources for extended periods of time and only involves passing one command to blender. A single blend file uploaded can be used to keep hundreds of workers busy. This is a good way to stress test your distribution system while you are developing it and you start building a user base in the process.\n\nIf you can't wait until development progresses, you will find tasks are processed using docker images, so far only a base system (debian), blender and luxrender docker images have been created. Some limited info can be found here that indicates you could build your own docker image that can perform other tasks. This wouldn't be supported within the main network, so you would also have to look at running your own worker nodes, tracker and modified client.\n\nAs another idea, you might be able to abuse the blender nodes. Blender includes a python interpreter that allows users to automate tasks, as well as extend blender through addons. While you may have trouble using more than the base python install, you can save scripts (and text data files as well as images) inside a blend file which you might be able to get running from a rendering task. This may involve an initial script registering a bpy.app.handler that runs at render_init which could perform non-blender related tasks.","783":"I recieved an answer by drlecks:\n\ncontract  Holders{\n\nuint _totalHolders; \/\/ you should initialize this to 0 in the constructor\nmapping (uint=> address ) private holders;\nmapping (address => uint) private shares;\n\nfunction GetShares(uint shares) public {\n    ... \n    holders[_totalHolders] = msg.sender;\n    shares[msg.sender] = shares; \n    _totalHolders++;\n    ...\n} \n\nfunction PayOut() public {\n    ...\n    uint shares;\n    for(uint i = 0 ; i<_totalHolders; i++) {\n        shares = shares[holders[i]];\n        ...\n    }\n    ... \n} \n\n\n}\n\nbut keep in mind that it will consume gas, and maybe its better that the stake holders withdraw their ETH and pay for gas themselfs.","784":"It is more complex than just MangoDB or not.\n\nTendermint is BFT in the partially synchronous way, it means that sometimes the network is totally asynchronous, but eventually, we will have a perfect window of synchronism.

There is rounds, validators and votes.\n\nTo have a precise idea, here a nice view on how it works : https:\/\/tendermint.readthedocs.io\/en\/master\/introduction.html#consensus-overview\n\nHashgraph is totally different in its structure. If both indeed use the Gossip protocol, there is some big differences : The DAG and virtual voting. By the structure of the hashgraph itself, you can virtual vote without sharing any information with the other peers. Hashgraph do not do any assumption on networking or processing time, it is completely asynchronous BFT. Finally, as with Tendermint, you have proofs on the BFT (Not the case at all with Blockchains !)\n\nNow, what is better ?\n\nActually, it depends on the implementation, but it appears that hashgraph have some great assets : Performance and above all fairness.\n\nPerformance because all the voting is virtual. Again, with Tendermint, all votes have to be sent between all the peers. The number of message is polynomial with the number of peers. Finally, you can not have fairness in a blockchain system, the miner decide in the transaction to put or not in the block and in which order. I am not a specialist of Tendermint but it seems that there is no fairness. Indeed, there is proposer nodes that broadcast the suggested block. Client just connect to the proposer who have the final word.\n\nIt depends how this points can be relevant for you. Are you in the asynchronous model ? If not, benchmarks of Tendermint have to be done, may be the convergence is better in partially synchronous models.

If the request was succesfull, a response is sent back so when you type in http:\/\/google.com in your browser which is the client, it uses http to request the Google main page and google's server uses http to send it to you as a response. This protocol is the backbone of world wide web. But http is not good enough anymore, infact it is totally broken and made the web completely centralised. These centralised servers are getting mor and more powerful by absorbing all of our data. Servers are given a unique IP address which define it's location. And becoz data is location addressed, if that location gets shutdown. That data is lost forever. But may be we could make a permanent web. A web where links never die. That's the vision of IPFS. It's peer to peer protocol, there is no central entity. People connect to each other directly. That means if you built a website on IPFS, it could never be shutdown by anyone, even if the government shuts down the internet during protests. People could still communicate with each other offline with IPFS and data would be owned by us, the people (not by any group). And becoz it's peer to peer so data transfer is much faster. The network gives data a content address, not an ip address so if you want to load a website, instead of your computer requesting from server across the world, it will find the nearest copy and your computer would retrieve it from there directly and if multiple people have copies of it, your computer would request it from all of them at the same time. The more peers, the faster the download. Videos would load so much faster. You could download the games 10 times faster. It is just better in every way.","796":"If all you have is a blockchain with Merkle-trees in each block, then this data structure by definition does not provide any means for searching anything efficiently:\n\n\nAll the hashes in the leafs of the Merkle tree are essentially pseudo-random, and contain no usable information about the content\nAll the hashes in the nodes of the merkle tree are pseudo-random bit sequences formed by hashing of concatenations of pseudo-random bit sequences (cryptographically strong pseudo-random-nonsense squared, log N times)\nThe hash pointing to the previous block is good for nothing except finding that previous block (pseudo-random-nonsense to the power of M, where M is the number of blocks)\nDitto for the hash of the block itself\n\n\nIn conclusion: no, the hashes of the blocks and the Merkle-trees are essentially useless for searching information. It's not only \"inefficient\", it's by design the most useless \"indexing\" of the data contained in the blockchain (because the hashes change completely as soon as a single bit in the data flips). If you want to find anything in such a data structure, there is absolutely nothing you can do except traversing it in linear time. All those hashes do is ensuring that the blockchain is not tampered with, and nothing else.\n\nHowever, nobody forces you to traverse the entire blockchain every time you want to find some information in it. Instead, you can\n\n\nTraverse the entire blockchain once\nBuild whatever additional data structures you need for finding what you need in the blockchain (indexes, search trees, graphs, fingerprints, whatever you can build from the data in the blockchain)\n\n\nand then on every request you simply\n\n\nuse the pre-computed data structures to execute your query efficiently\n\n\nand every time a new block is appended\n\n\nupdate all the precomputed data structures.\n\n\nAlternatively: rebuild your data structures occasionally, treat the last few blocks separately.\n\nIt's very much the same with \"the internet\". It's a network of nodes with content in them. How do you find anything in those nodes? Do you traverse all the nodes every time you want to find anything? No, you ask a search engine. Because the search engine has already done the job in the background, and visited (some) of the nodes in the network, and indexed the content, so that you can find stuff in it easily. Same thing here, except that your graph is linear (if you forget the orphan branches), and that the nodes previously added to the graph don't change too often (never, unless someone disproportionally powerful attacks your blockchain). The immutability of the previously added nodes should certainly be used for efficiency when you update your data structures: if you already have seen those nodes, there is no need to re-scan them every time (unlike in the internet, where content of the previously indexed nodes nodes can change).\n\nAnother (obvious) alternative, if you can influence the design of the blockchain: think about what might be useful ahead of time, bake the required data structures into the blockchain right from the start, so that not only the blockchain itself, but also the data structures that help navigate the blockchain cannot be modified easily.","797":"Figured it out.

Bitcoin mining itself is the process of adding new bitcoin transactions to the blockchain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions.  A new block of bitcoin transactions is added to blockchain every 10 minutes and has been since bitcoin was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.   Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, the bitcoin miner who successfully added the block is awarded newly generated bitcoins AND all the mining fees from people who sent a bitcoin transaction during that 10 minutes.  Right now a new block rewards 25 new bitcoins, which is a ton of money. \n  https:\/\/bitcoindaily.org\/bitcoin-guides\/what-is-bitcoin-mining\/\n  \n  \n  Second question :\n  \n  \n  What happens when all the bitcoins are mined?\n  \n  The bitcoin inflation rate steadily trends downwards. At the time of writing, more than 3 out of every 4 bitcoins that will ever exist has already been mined, and the annual inflation rate is just 4%. The block reward given to miners is made up of newly-created bitcoins plus transaction fees. As inflation goes to zero miners will obtain an income only from transaction fees which will provide an incentive to keep mining to make transactions irreversible.\n  \n  Due to deep technical reasons, block space is a scarce commodity, getting a transaction mined can be seen as purchasing a portion of it. By analogy, on average every 10 minutes a fixed amount of land is created and no more, people wanting to make transactions bid for parcels of this land. The sale of this land is what supports the miners even in a zero-inflation regime. The price of this land is set by demand for transactions (because the supply is fixed and known) and the mining difficulty readjusts around this to keep the average interval at 10 minutes.\n  https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Controlled_supply#What_happens_when_all_the_bitcoins_are_mined.3F","800":null,"801":"Possibly, it is block_voting.sol.

You can't just write code (smart contracts) and deploy them in the Ethereum-Blockchain and expect them to run for free. You need ether for that which acts as a fuel for ether.

Decentralized storage options are:\n\n\nStoring everything in blockchain itself\nPeer to peer file system, such as IPFS Decentralized cloud file storages, such as Storj, Sia, Ethereum Swarm, etc. \nDistributed Databases, such as Apache Cassandra,\nRethink DB, etc.\nBigChainDB\nTies DB\n\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider them all in detail:\n\n\nStoring everything in blockchain itself: Storing everything in blockchain is the simplest solution. Currently most of the simple decentralized applications work exactly this way. However, this approach has significant drawbacks. First of all transactions to blockchain are slow to confirm. It may seem to be fast for money transfer (anyone can wait a minute), but it is extremely slow for a rich application data flow. Rich application may require many thousands transactions per second. Secondly, it is immutable. The immutability is the strength of blockchain that gives it high robustness but it is a weakness for a data storage. User may change their profile or replace their photo, still all the previous data will sit in blockchain forever and can be seen by anyone. The immutability results in one more drawback - the capacity. If all the applications would keep their data in blockchain, the blockchain size will grow rapidly, exceeding publicly available hard drive capacity. Full nodes can require special hardware. It may result in dangerous centralization of blockchain. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why storing data in blockchain only is not a good option for a rich decentralized application.\nPeer to peer file system, such as InterPlanetary File System. IPFS allows to share files on client computers and unites them in the global file system. The technology is based on BitTorrent protocol and Distributed Hash Table. There are several good moments. It is really peer to peer - to share anything first put it on your own computer. It will be downloaded only if anyone needs it. It is content addressable, so it is impossible to forge content by the given address. Popular files can be downloaded very quickly thanks to BitTorrent protocol. However it also has some drawbacks. You should stay online if you want to share your files. At least before someone becomes interested and wants to download them from you. It serves only static files, they can not be modified or removed once uploaded. And of course you can not search these files by their meaningful content.\nDecentralized cloud file storages: There are also decentralized cloud file storages that lift some of IPFS limitations. From the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view these storages are just cloud storages like Dropbox, for example. The difference is that the content is hosted on user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s computers who offer their hard drive space for rent, rather than in datacenters. There are plenty of such projects nowadays. For example, Sia, Storj, Ethereum Swarm. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to stay online to share your files anymore. Just upload the file and it is available in the cloud. These storages are highly reliable, fast enough, have enormous capacity. Still they serve static files only, no content search anyway and, since they are built on the rented hardware, they are not free.\nDistributed Databases: Since we need to store structured data and seek for advanced query capabilities we may look at the distributed noSql databases. Why noSql? Because strict transactional SQL databases can not be truly distributed due to the restrictions of the CAP-theorem. To make a database distributed we must sacrifice either consistency or availability. NoSQL databases choose availability over consistency replacing it with so called \u00e2\u0080\u009ceventual consistency\u00e2\u0080\u009d where all the database nodes in the network become consistent some time later. There are many mature realizations of such databases, for example MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, RethinkDB and so on. They are very good - fast, scalable, fault tolerant, support rich query language but still have fatal drawback for our application. They are not Byzantine-proof. All the nodes of the cluster fully trust each other. So any malicious node can destroy the whole database.\nBigChainDB: There is another project called BigChainDB that claims to solve the data storage and transaction speed problem. It is also a blockchain but with enormous data capacity and really fast transactions. Let us see how it is possible. BigChainDB is build upon RethinkDB cluster, I mentioned this NoSQL database on the previous slide. BigChainDB uses it to store all the blocks and transactions. That is why it shows such a high throughput - it is the one of the underlying noSQL database. All the BigChainDB nodes (denoted BDB on the slide) are connected to the cluster and have full write access to the database. Here comes a problem - the whole BigChainDB is not byzantine-proof! Any malicious BDB node can destroy the RethinkDB cluster. The BigChainDB team is aware of this problem and promises to solve it sometime in the future, however it is the corner stone of the architecture and changing it may not be possible.Anyway, BigChainDB may be good for a private blockchain. But in my opinion, to avoid confusion it should have been named BigPrivateBlockchain. It is not an option for a public storage.\nTies DB: The currently available options could be a good public database. The closest to the ideal are the noSql databases. The only thing they lack is byzantine fault tolerance. The Ties.Network Database: ties.network is a deep modification of the Cassandra database and offers a preferable solution: The TiesDB inherits the majority of features from the underlying noSQL databases and adds byzantine fault tolerance and incentives. With these features it can become a public database and enable feature-rich applications on Ethereum and other blockchains with smart contracts. The database is writable by any user. But the users are identified by their public key and all the requests are signed. Once created, record remembers its creator who becomes an owner of the record. After that the record can be modified only by the owner. Everyone can read all records, because the database is public. All the permissions are checked on request and replication. Additional permissions can be managed via a smart contract.\n\n\nsource: here","867":"Seems like ansible is not able to log into bdb-node-01.

The practical limits are, you don't want to store very large chunks of data (so, not video); you probably don't want to store frequently changing data (so, not a thesis paper you're revising) -- unless it's important somehow to record every single change forever.\n\nBecause, its other feature is, once something is written to a blockchain, it's there forever. \n\nNeed to fix a typo? Then you add a new record with a correction. \n\nNeed to delete a record? Too bad, you can't. Best you can do is enter a new record saying that the record you wish to delete is \"obsolete\" or \"repudiated\" or \"no longer valid\" or \"should be considered as deleted.\" \n\nIn short, it's wise to treat your blockchain as a permanent record.\n\n1 Slow: the Bitcoin blockchain runs about 3 transactions per second (tps) and the Ethereum blockchain runs about 30 tps.\n\n2 Expensive: the Bitcoin blockchain cost an average of US$ 8.22 per transaction in November 2017 according to Digiconomist."},"# of Vote for

All it does is enforce the consensus rules_. There is no such association between: 1. accounts and public keys 2. accounts and BTC addresses 3. BTC addresses and balance  The wallet support that you might have found in bitcoind just keeps track of all its relevant addresses. It requires specific indexing (e.g. if you import keys from external you have to reindex it).\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0fcracker79\n                \n                Dec 29, 2018 at 16:27\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Try to think of bitcoin as a collection of outputs that can be redeemed by executing cryptographic scripts. The balance is thus the sum of unspent outputs associated to a specific address. Just to be clear, each private ECDSA key has a corresponding public key. A BTC address is a hash of that public key. Thus, if you are implementing a wallet, you can easily track down all the outputs associated to that key and ultimately to your BTC address.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0fcracker79\n                \n                Dec 29, 2018 at 16:32\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Ok. Are these two statements true?  1) \"Account\" is an abstraction that wallet software provides.  2) A bitcoin address is a hash of a public key, and thus the system validates that transfers have sufficient balances by unhashing the public key when a transaction is submitted encoded with the corresponding private key.  Does this mean that every address (every hashed public key) can only correspond to one public key? In other words, I guess this means that the hash is guaranteed to be unique for each public key, right?

Correct 2. More precisely, bitcoind verifies the consensus rules (e.g. an output cannot be spent twice). A wallet normally creates a transaction provided that it has enough unspent outputs to send the specified amount of BTC. The user has typically the view of total balance, so he does not see what the wallet system does under the hood.  Let's say that each public key has only one BTC address. This does not apply for every address type, but that's most of the case.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0fcracker79\n                \n                Dec 29, 2018 at 17:02\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    \n                \u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\n            Show 3 more comments","2":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","3":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","4":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","5":null,"6":"My problem was with the spelling of contract.

So basically if I have 3 addresses of unspent btc, there will be 3 inputs and 3 outputs to grandmas address? Or only one output? I'm asking this because I wondering about the next use case. Two buyers are trying to buy the same thing (e.g. 5 BTC) and it happens in same btc transaction. So both of them are having multiple addresses and are sending to sellers address. What if one buyer sends 1 BTC instead of 5?

The consensus will become broken.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0saman.shahmohamadi\n                \n                Dec 17, 2018 at 18:03\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                The transactions are signed and cannot be modified by the validator.

The other nodes will not accept new blocks from that validator node, as the transaction(s) in the new block will fail verification.

It requires the honest nodes to have the capability to check past validations should they encounter a situation where that seems necessary. For example, directly-connected nodes can share their current tip hash. If they conflict, they could exchange information to see who is \"wrong\" and, in the process, might discover treachery. But they don't have to be actively searching for this type of treachery in the absence of evidence. As I said, there's huge innovation going on in this space.

Yes, it was helpful. The idea is to build a mobile app. which uses Ethereum and IPFS (for storing app. files and app. state data) and interact with them directly using Ethereum ABIs and IPFS APIs.

The closest that I can think of now is Blockgram here which is using React: github.com\/randallkanna\/Blockgram\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Zulhilmi Zainudin\n                \n                Nov 13, 2018 at 14:54\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Why cannot I use the IPFS to store app. data? I was thinking of storing the app. data in the form of JSON and stored as a file. Also, there are possibilities to use solutions like Orbit DB?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0KayKay\n                \n                Nov 14, 2018 at 10:58\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Okay, I get you wrong.

I have been reading about file storing within the blockchain.

IPFS is not a blockchain, it is a versioned peer to peer file sharing system (uses BitTorrent technology), you can see it as a distributed file system as files are stored on users file systems across the network. More blockchain-oriented solutions would be projects like Sia or filecoin (uses IPFS) but again data is not stored on the blockchain itself.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Yann39\n                \n                Nov 5, 2018 at 12:48\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","129":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","130":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","131":"It's not working, I got this error [Unhandled rejection StatusCodeError: 404 - \"Not found\"]\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Noura Aziz\n                \n                Nov 2, 2018 at 10:22\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                It's because you are catching the error and then throwing it.

It helps a lot! Anyway the problem I face, for a project, I may need to create multiple addresses, which may accept eth or erc20 tokens. But the tranasctions(Trasnfer IN) to those multiple addresses are expected to be very small.  And some of the addresses even need not have ETH transferred in. So I can't easily transfer OUT the token, without adding gas to the account. While means, even more gas. Is there a way, in ethereum, I can have have all these multiple addresses tagged to a single private key, so that I can transfer with the gas stored from the common private key?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Jab2Tech\n                \n                Sep 4, 2018 at 7:34\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                That is not possible.

So I am running a Windows machine, and to execute the above I am using an Amazon EC2 cloud instance and connecting with it using puTTy. So, I cannot use local host on my own operating system. So in the below example: var StellarSdk = require('stellar-sdk') var server = new StellarSdk.Server('horizon-testnet.stellar.org'); Can use the IP address of the VM instead of the URL horizon-testnet.stellar.org. If the answer to the above question is 'Yes', how should I enter the IP, which format will it be in, should I also specify the port like 8000?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Deb\n                \n                Aug 26, 2018 at 16:25\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Yes. The port will be 8000, as you defined -p \"8000:8000\" when starting the docker container. The ip address will be the address of the ec2 instance (name or number is fine), but you would need to define a security group that allows inbound TCP on port 8000.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Synesso\n                \n                Aug 26, 2018 at 23:53\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                So I downloaded node and connected to the localhost:8000 and it got connected. So one last question, now I am using the javascript sdk, what is the javascript code for doing a transaction. And how do I get funds without friendbot. If you can please write an example code. I have gone through this link stellar.org\/developers\/js-stellar-sdk\/reference\/examples.html, but it is not clear enough and more importantly, it talks about using the stellar test network.

I do know that hiding stuff behind msg.sender is pointless because of the visibility of, well, everything... I just needed this contract as a rather easy example. It seems like Myetherwallet doesn't get msg.sender in the call I made. I tested it with a simple return msg.sender call and indeed it just returns 0x000[...].

Efficiency is irrelevant if you are forced to an existing standard. You have to use it, no matter what it is.

Miners have full freedom. They may decide to not include any transactions in block. They can include only transactions which satisfy some criteria, for example fee per byte is greater then some value. They can include all transactions even without fee. Maximum block size is just limiting how many transaction bytes they can include. If non-confirmed transaction pool is greater than limit, then the most profitable way for miner is to include only transactions with big fee.

The new code is performing asynchronous and is much faster than the previous one. Executors... finishes the 50 calls 0.4 seconds, huge improvement from 11 seconds. Strangely, when I ran the IntStream method, it's also now working asynchronously and System.currentThread() is prints out ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1,5,main [unique]. I have no idea why it's all of a sudden running async. Would love to know why. It's also not as fast as it completes execution in 1.4 sec.

As for Bitcoin and Ethereum, each and every transaction is publicly available. e.g. blockchain.com\/explorer Every full node that wants to particiapate has to verify every transaction, down to the first (as for Bitcoin at least)\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0mchl18\n                \n                Jan 8, 2021 at 15:02\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Interesting link. Shows amount, not who, what, where. Of course the hashed address for example is not reversible. My understanding is ... key pairs are involved. And that means a key chain which can allow multiple people access. Not too much unlike a file system ACL also.Of course, when it's presented publicly like that, hashes, but does the real data under that layer have the details of the transaction, encrypted. First step in understanding: Can you look at your own BTC transaction history in clear text?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0gseattle\n                \n                Jan 9, 2021 at 16:29\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @gseattle Bottom right, there are are recent transactions.

Your question revolved around persisting data, so I gave you the best solution for that scenario...but in general (even in more practical databases), it's not ideal to change the data structure itself.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0ReyHaynes\n                \n                Jun 5, 2018 at 12:11\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                My question was indeed only about persisting the data.

In the other case where the notary is a 3rd Party, how does all the nodes in the consortium come to an agreement to choose this 3rd party to run the nodes.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Delin Mathew\n                \n                Jun 1, 2018 at 14:48\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Hey, can you spin this out as a separate question please? :)\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Joel\n                \n                Jun 4, 2018 at 8:39\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Hi Joel, please find the question here: stackoverflow.com\/questions\/50793939\/\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Thank you :)\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Delin Mathew\n                \n                Jun 11, 2018 at 9:04\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","521":null,"522":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","523":"Thanks, But that is not what I meant.

With a CouchDB as a stateDB, for every get\/putState, peer needs to issue a GET\/POST REST API call over a secure HTTP. As a result, the performance degrades. We got a maximum of 700 tps with CouchDB.

I can unbox their example and take a look (but I don't know what changes you've made, if any).

You can have a contract that emits events and setup your clients identically to respond to those events. However, a constant contract call (ie, balance retrieval) cannot emit events (emitting an event can only be done in a transaction). I don't think I can provide more help without a more specific issue and code. But, it doesn't seem like this has anything to do with Truffle or smart contracts and is an issue with your client.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Adam Kipnis\n                \n                Apr 5, 2018 at 17:24\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                If you feel like taking a look at what's going on, you can download the pet shop example tutorial I linked in my question.

Thanks for the suggestion of using Composer but it currently doesn't support Sawtooth (yet). How would handle the Assets as they transform from 1:N (one to many) in the blockchain. When you start with raw material, it is \"transformed\" through out the supply chain, starting off as a single unit then being \"transformed\" into different products and units. Sounds to me that I need to create new assets for every \"new product\", even if it originated from the same raw material. Perhaps I need to just add a reference to the original raw material?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0mcarvalho21\n                \n                Apr 4, 2018 at 1:15\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","696":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","697":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","698":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","699":null,"700":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","701":"Hi @Steve, just wondering if you'd be able to help with another bit that I'm stuck with?

While revoking write permissions and locking out the admin might seem like enough, it won't protect the hard drives from being directly overwritten (maybe with noise). The database needs to detect and recover from such things, if it can. Generally speaking, the more copies the better, because then it gets more difficult to wreck them all.

You're better off resubmitting your transaction (with the same nonce) and paying a higher price.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Adam Kipnis\n                \n                Jan 14, 2021 at 19:24\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                How does it work with gas fees?

Follow up question: with the same script, do you know what would be necessary for having the Integers in this script to use Int64 rather than Int32 (as I suspect would be wanted for the blockchain's index?)  I get an error if I just switch the Integer types over to Int64.  Specifically:  instance variable '@index' of Block must be Int64, not Int32  I'm assuming this is because the type inference engine sees an undeclared integer in Block.new(0, data, \"0\") and assumes it's automatically Int32?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Kelsey Hannan\n                \n                Jan 17, 2018 at 21:50\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Indeed.

If there are no conflicting stakeholders, then you could use stuff like Kafka or RabbitMQ which can offer millions of TPS. If there are, you fix the number, difficulty, permissions, and just use it an audited DB with consensus... which again makes it superceded by technologies like Cassandra DB, which uses consensus algos as well, if I'm not wrong.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0snugghash\n                \n                Jan 31, 2019 at 22:43\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","891":null,"892":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","893":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","894":"Hi Zein, We are also using same azure setup for ethereum.

Ensure the password you have given as this required when sending transactions from this account. \n\nLet's setup another node (Node 2) and connect to the Node 1.\n\n**Step 6: **\n\nNote: We are going to use the same machine for both node 1 and node 2 in our case.\n\nLet's start geth in node 2 with the below command\n\n$ geth --datadir data2 init genesis.json\n\n\nStep 7: \n\nLet's start the node that we setup in the Step 6 with the following command\n\n$ geth --datadir blkchain2 --nodiscover --networkid 1234 --port 60606 console\n\n\nNote: We have to specify the port here as a default port has already been occupied by the node 1. \n\nStep 8: \n\nWith Step 7 you should be in the ethereum node console. Run the following command to know the node 2 details that has just started running. \n\n> admin.nodeInfo\n\n\nStep 9: \n\nLet's create a new account in Node 2 with the following command\n\n> personal.newAccount()\n\n\nStep 10:\n\nLet's connect both the nodes now. \n\nWhen we ran the command admin.nodeInfo in both node1 and node2 earlier we see a key with the name enode which is of the following format. \n\nenode:\/\/ENODE@IP:PORT\n\n\nIf you want to know how enode is created check this awesome response by benjamin \n\nCopy both those enode addresses and run the following command on both node 1 and node 2 consoles respectively. \n\n> admin.addPeer(\"enode of node1\"); \/\/ run in console of node 1\n> admin.addPeer(\"enode of node2\"); \/\/ run in console of node 2\n\n\nNow, both the nodes are part of the private network and you can interact with one another. \n\nStep 11: \n\nAs a verification let's mine on Node 1 and see its reflecting on Node 2. \n\nGo to the console of node 1 and run the following command\n\n> miner.start(1)\n\n\nThe above command will give lot of verbose, in that one important field you should observe is the blockheight (or block number). \n\nNow, go to Node 2 and run the following command to see that the block that was mined is now showing in Node 2. \n\n\n  eth.getBlockNumber\n\n\nYou should now see that the block that was mined in Node 1 is successfully propagated to Node 2. \n\nSo, here we end for now. \n\nAny questions feel free to ask me. \n\nPS 1: With different versions of web3 that you are using some commands may vary, but on the high level things should remain mostly the same. \n\nPS 2: If you want to connect a Node 1 running in machine 1 and Node 2 running in machine 2, you just need to run the same. But maybe you need to properly verify the enode of Node 1. Also, you might need to tweak your firewall to allow the bi-directional transactional flows.","15":null,"16":"In blockchain concept there are several nodes that share a ledger, in which each node participates in the network (inserting data in the ledger and validating this data).

If your wallet has 3 addresses to which 0.5 btc has been sent and not spent, and you then send 1.25 btc somewhere then all 3 of those 0.5 btc unspent transaction outputs will be used to build the 1.25 plus a new address for the 0.25 change. The sending wallet will also own the address to which 0.25 in change was sent. In this way a single btc wallet can end up owning millions of addresses\n\nIn practice it's quite likely that the total you send will be composed of multiple inputs so if you're trying to prove you send your grandma 1.25 BTC you don't look in transaction X inputs for your single address that originated 1.25, you look in tran X outputs for your grandma's address that received a total of 1.25. Bear in mind that in this day and age of multiple output transactions your btc transaction might cite 100 outputs, 12 of which are grandma's address and which add up to 1.25 btc\n\nYes, one btc transaction can hold tens or more payments to tens or more different individuals \n\n\n\nEdit in response to comment #1:\n\nThere might be any number of outputs, it's totally down to your wallet how it decides to send them out. Remember that if the inputs don't add up to the outputs then just like buying a packet of gum with a twenty dollar note, there will be some change. When you look at the transaction on a block explorer that your wallet built, there might be 100 inputs, 100 outputs (if you had a lot of people to pay) and even multiple changes if multiple inputs were split and sent back to yourself. If you think of your wallet bitcoin balance like blocks of cheese in the delicatessen, they all weigh different things, 3 people come and all want different amounts, the deli server person might get 6 blocks of cheese, have to cut them and combine them in different ways multiple times, then hand them over. They don't necessarily become recombined either; people might walk away with multiple little bits of cheese making the total amount they wanted, and then if they want to give that cheese as gifts, they subdivide it.. Ultimately subdivision of cheese continues until all you end up with are crumbs, that cannot be transacted because putting them all in one transaction makes the transaction too big (kilobytes) for the network to allow, so you might engage in an exercise of consolidating them; sending them to yourself in exact multiples so no subdivision occurs. Thus they become big lumps of cheese again. If you hear people talking about wallets being dusty, it means they're tracking large numbers of tiny amounts - dust.\n\nI think I understand the confusion now though; If two people agree to buy something from you for 5 BTC, one sends you 5 but the other is dishonest and only sends you 1. These may occur in the same block, but they wouldn't occur in the same transaction because they originated from different wallets. If your puzzle is over how to tell them apart, i.e. which person sent you the 5 and which person sent you the 1, this is why you get your wallet to generate 2 different addresses and give one to each person. You could always tell that you were sent a 5 and a 1 because of separate transactions, but when you look at the different addresses the 5 and the 1 were sent to you can know which person sent the 1, because of the address they used. Again, you're looking at the output side of the transaction, not the input side, because the dishonest person who sent the 1 can look on the block explorer and find out the input details the honest person used, and then claim to be the honest person.","18":null,"19":"Convert the time to seconds since the UNIX epoch:\n\n\n  $ date -ud \"1\/1\/2017\"\n  Sun Jan  1 00:00:00 UTC 2017\n  $ date -ud \"1\/1\/2017\" +%s\n  1483228800\n\n\nYou can also use Epoch Converter to convert it.\n\nAdd three zeroes to that number and append it to a blockchain.com URL:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/btc\/blocks\/1483228800000\n\nAnd there you have it:\n\n\n  446033 (Main Chain)   2017-01-01 00:02:33\n\n\nAnd if you want the previous block, clock on the previous button and scroll to the end:\n\n\n  446032 (Main Chain)   2016-12-31 23:44:04\n\n\nSo block 446,032 was mined at 12\/31\/2016 at 23:44:04 UTC and block 446,033 was mined at two minutes and 33 seconds after midnight.","20":"Definitions are important here. \n\nBlockchain\n\nFirst of all, the terms \"blockchain technology\" and \"the blockchain\" are overused, often meaningless terms that have different meanings in different contexts.

This is not really a new concept (e.g. merkle trees).\n\nProof of Work\n\nProof of work extends the blockchain data structure by providing rules (agreed to by network participants) that enforce how much work must be done before a hash is accepted as valid (it must meet a maximum value threshold). The lower the threshold, the more work must have been done (on average) to calculate the block hash. Providing a valid block hash becomes a proof-of-work. This can make it much more difficult to modify past blocks, as the same amount of work must be done in order for the network to accept it as valid, thus distributed consensus can be achieved. This is why \"blockchain technology\" was invented, to achieve distributed consensus without relying on a third party. \"Blockchain technology\" is not really that interesting without the proof-of-work component and so it depends on what your definition of \"blockchain technology\" happens to be.\n\nPrivate\/Permissioned Blockchains\n\nIn the private\/permissioned blockchain model, nodes are only allowed to join the private network if they get permission. Not everyone can participate in consensus. Thus, consensus is controlled by the authority or authorities who allow new participants.\n\nPrivate, permissioned blockchain applications may or may not use proof of work, and do not allow anyone to join and participate and contribute to consensus by providing proof-of-work. Because the authority gets to decide who contributes to consensus, it is not a distributed consensus, but a federated consensus. If an actor becomes malicious, or doesn't align with their goals, they can be removed from the network. This is not the case with a distributed network, the work can be rejected, but they can keep attempting to submit work.\n\n\n  Okay. But i have seen that so many big corporates are moving to IBM\n  blockchain and also lot of projects on Hyperledger is coming up. Are\n  you saying that it all is a crap?\n\n\nI can't comment on projects without specific references, but I think one could assess whether or not it makes sense to use \"blockchain technology\" as defined above, for a given project. If it does not need to achieve distributed consensus, there are much less expensive, energy intensive ways to manage data, like a database, but I wouldn't consider that \"blockchain technology\".","21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":"Please find below responses from my end.

How would the citizens vote ? will they need to buy ether in a exchange (or mining ?) ?\n\n\n\n  Yes, for starters they have to pay the gas.

In this case maybe the government can bear the amount. \n\n\n\nhow can i block votes outside my district if everybody in the network can send data to my smart contract ?\n\n\n\n  You can run consortium chain like quorum to limit the participants to a specific group.

This content can never truly be guaranteed to be available (maybe you're offline, maybe all of the peers with it are offline, maybe you're behind a powerful NAT, maybe the network split and the peers with the content are on the other partition).\nIn IPFS the simple or decentralized system an object is online only when the nodes that are holding the object spend energy.\n\nAnd your second part,IPFS is mainly for the permanence and permanence!=persistent.IPFS itself currently handles this by means of \"pinning\", which excludes an object and its children from garbage collection within one IPFS node. \n\nWork is going on to make it more persistent.One of them is Filecoin (paper), and there a couple of concrete ideas for an ipfs-cluster tool.","121":null,"122":null,"123":null,"124":null,"125":"Proof of Work puzzle types similar to Bitcoin are independent of the data size.

You may also have a lack of trust between different entities within the same organization, and a private blockchain could help with this.\n\nEach member of your private blockchain will hold the ledger, so no need to trust a central authority (again even within the same organization) :\n\n\n\nAnd even if there are \"not many nodes\", it is still better to have to trust 51% of multiple decentralized nodes than 100% of a single centralized node.\n\nWe often see allusion to distributed databases, which are closer to private blockchains. But actually the closest technology would be rather distributed ledgers like Corda, IOTA (which uses a \"tangle\" and not a blockchain), etc. so blockchain is just another form of distributed ledger, but by far no more complicated to set up.\n\nCompared to a distributed database, in my opinion the blockchain brings you immutability, transparency (native history, no need to implement it), better security and greatly simplifies synchronization (no need for jobs, materialized views, triggers, scripts, etc.). And especially removes centralized control (any provider of a centralized solution can technically and more or less easily alter your data without leaving a trace (delete logs, backups, etc.), in a blockchain it is very difficult). We could also talk about higher availability and certainly lower implementation\/maintenance cost.\n\nPrivate blockchains can also be \"permissioned\" or \"permissionless\", following this anonymity\/trust schema :\n\n\n\nIn permissioned blockchains, permissions and roles management is interesting because in addition to the application level, they are controlled at the persistence level for each transaction, so it is not limited as often to a technical user used to access the database. Thus an invalid transaction will be automatically refused by the network even if your client application has a security breach.\n\nThen you have many other interesting things like smart contracts that allow you to guarantee an immutable process. You can for example formal audit a contract with other entities in your network, or with a customer, and confirm with him that the data processing will be done in such a way and only in this way, or even trigger actions at a specific date, etc. In some private blockchain like Hyperledger Fabric you also have the concept of channels if you still need some confidentiality within the same blockchain (isolation of transactions), which again would not be easy to set up in a distributed or even centralized database.\n\nBlockchain is a hot topic at the moment and everyone is trying to get in for anything and everything (FOMO), but of course if you don't need that points (trust, immutability, etc.) you may still go with a traditional central database, which will not require new skills and probably be more performant (even if private blockchains can reach several thousand transactions per second). Also permissioned blockchains are not intended for use with a very large number of participants (you have to identify them), so you may again fall back to a database or a private permisionless blockchain like Hyperledger Sawtooth.","136":null,"137":null,"138":null,"139":null,"140":null,"141":null,"142":"Is it possible to store images on the Ethereum blockchain?\n\n\nIt's absolutely possible!\n\nShould you do it?

The speed of catching up will be dependant on how much more than 50 percent you have. This attack works because this way you have beaten any other potential miners in the rate of producing of new blocks, so you are always producing blocks faster than anybody else on the network, hence ensuring that your chain will become longest.\nSo your evilminer, given that he has 10 percent of mining power, would never be able to advance the length of his chain beyond the main chain. The only other possible way is to use a nonce of lower difficulty to speed up block production, but such a block would be rejected by any other node in the network deeming it as invalid. \n\n\nHence, in short the only way evilminer can make other nodes accept his blocks is to make his chain the longest, and that can only be done if he has more than 50 percent mining power of the network.\n\nEdit 1 :\nConsider the computation power of every participant of the network and assume that when you sum these up, you get 100. Now if you have 10 percent of this total, it means your likelihood of finding a new block is higher than others who have lesser computation power than you. However, this does not guarantee that you will definitely find the nonce first. \n\nFinding the hash that satisfies the difficulty depends on probability. You brute force your way through a large set of numbers until your hash satisfies the difficulty. It maybe possible that someone having mere 0.5 percent of total computation power finds the nonce first. However, the faster you can crunch these numbers, the higher the chance that you will find the nonce first.\n\nSo if somehow you have more than 50 percent of total computation power, that means you are processing these hashes faster than anybody else, and hence this increases the likelihood that you find the nonce first most of the times. \n\nAlso, this process of finding the nonce, is repeated for every block.

As the block variables are obviously shared within the same block, you can easily use internal messages to yield the same outcome.\nOther methods are like using blockhash of current or some past block\nor blockhash of a past block combined with a private seed. block.blockhash(block.number) function is used in these cases. However, at the moment of transaction execution in the EVM, the blockhash of the block that is being created is not yet known for obvious reasons and the EVM will always yield zero. If we are trying it with the blockhash of a previous block, an attacker can make an exploit contract with the same code in order to call the target contract via an internal message. The \u00e2\u0080\u009crandom\u00e2\u0080\u009d numbers for the two contracts will be the same.\nEven if we combine the blockhash with a private seed, being transparent in nature, the blockchain must not be used to store secrets in plaintext. It is trivial to extract the value of the private variable pointer from the contract storage and supply it as an argument to an exploit.\nSome Areas Worth Exploring\n\nExternal oracles\nSignidice\nCommit\u00e2\u0080\u0093reveal approach\n\nWith External oracles like Oraclize, smart contracts can request data from web APIs such as currency exchange rates, weather forecasts, and stock prices (like random.org). The key drawback of this approach is that it is centralized. Will Oraclize daemon tamper with the results? Can we trust random.org?\nInstead of Oraclize, we can also use BTCRelay which is a bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains. Using BTCRelay, smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain can request future Bitcoin blockhashes and use them as a source of entropy.\nSignidice is an algorithm based on cryptographic signatures that can be used for random number generation in smart contracts involving only two parties: the player and the house. The algorithm works as follows:\n\nThe player makes a bet by calling a smart contract.\nThe house sees the bet, signs it with its private key, and sends the signature to the smart contract.\nThe smart contract verifies the signature using the known public key.\nThis signature is then used to generate a random number.\n\nCommit\u00e2\u0080\u0093reveal approach consists of two phases:\n\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommit\u00e2\u0080\u009d stage, when the parties submit their cryptographically protected secrets to the smart contract.\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009creveal\u00e2\u0080\u009d stage, when the parties announce cleartext seeds, the smart contract verifies that they are correct, and the seeds are used to generate a random number.\n\nA better implementation of the commit\u00e2\u0080\u0093reveal approach is Randao. Commit\u00e2\u0080\u0093reveal can be combined with future blockhashes to make it more secure.\nThis pretty much covers all the methods for random number generation using Ethereum.","216":"Though there are limited information shows above, the peer log give the essential hint about the problem:\n\nWARN 044 channel [mychannel]: MSP error: the supplied identity is not valid: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of \"x509: ECDSA verification failure\" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate \"ca.org1.example.com\" \n\n\nHere is the suggestions that may help your to solve this problem:\n\n\nChange your peer's logging level to DEBUG on docker-compose file, you will be more easily to find the solution followed by the debug information.\nMake sure your CA container is running and its logs not throws out error, like some certifications verify error, which commonly causes by wrong configuration. \nNow that the logs shows up some information about x509 ECDSA, which related to the signature and and the peers endorsement keycert.

There are tons of good blogs present on internet for you to explore.  Let me try to provide you a brief summary with my limited knowledge of distributed ledgers.\n\nBlockchain is actually theoretically tamperproof (Someone can still make a 51% attack on blockchain, but that would require huge computational power)\n\nWhy is it so? Two reasons :\n\nA cryptographic fingerprint unique to each block\n\nconsensus protocol, the process by which the nodes in the network agree on a shared history.\n\nThe fingerprint, called a hash, takes a lot of computing time and energy to generate initially(This time and energy increases or decreases depending upon the total computing power present with the miners). It thus serves as a proof that the miner who added the block to the blockchain did the computational work to earn a bitcoin reward (for this reason, Bitcoin is said to use a \u00e2\u0080\u009cproof-of-work\u00e2\u0080\u009d protocol). This hash is just a merkle hash of all the transactions included in this block. It also serves as a kind of seal, since altering the block would require generating a new hash. Verifying whether or not the hash matches its block, however, is easy, and once the nodes have done so they update their respective copies of the blockchain with the new block. This is the consensus protocol.\n\nThe final security element is that the hashes also serve as the links in the blockchain: each block includes the previous block\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique hash. So if you want to change an entry in the ledger retroactively, you have to calculate a new hash not only for the block it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in but also for every subsequent block. And you have to do this faster than the other nodes can add new blocks to the chain (On an average a new block is added every 10 minutes). So unless you have computers that are more powerful than the rest of the nodes combined (and even then, success isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guaranteed), all the alterations needs to be done in 10 minutes window, any blocks you add will conflict with existing ones, and the other nodes will automatically reject your alterations. This is what makes the blockchain tamperproof, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmutable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat would happen if you deploy your own blockchain with proof of work?\nIt really depends how many blocks are already present on your blockchain and difficulty of your proof of work algorithm. If complexity is low and few miners are competing for the next block, anybody with more computational power with all the miners combined can make their own valid fork,  with transactions suited to their needs. \n\nI want to manipulate a transaction at n-10th block?\n\nlets say the number of blocks in Bitcoin blockchain as of this instant is n,  and you want to alter a transaction at  n-10th block, thats is 10 blocks back in time. \n\nMiners will compete to put the next block n+1 th block, the time frame for which is approximately 10 minutes, you can also compete but for you to win you must have computational power as compared to miners which is around  51200544 TH\/s.\nProbabilistically speaking if you have 1TH\/s mining power, your chance of solving a block is 1\/ 51200544, Lets say the hardware to calculate 1TH\/s costs around  1000$, just calculate the cost to have an idea .\n\nAs already mentioned, Every block has a merkle hash included in the header which is turn depends upon every transaction included in the block and a difficulty which needs to be solved (The stuff miners calculate). This merkle root is included in the header of next block.\n\nso if you want to change a transaction or multiple transactions at n-10th block, You need to do two things for n-10th block.\n1. Calculate the merkle root again as transactions have changed.\n2. Solve the difficulty.\n\nSince the merkle root has changed, you need to solve the difficulty of every block following this block till this very time instant, to make it a valid branch.\n\nThe time frame to do all this is just 10 minutes, because in next 10 minutes , another block will be pushed by miners in the chain.","218":"In order for private data collections to work, you need to set up cross-organization gossip.

What about the\n  consensus algorithms?

Each such namespace has an chaincode has its own endorsement policy. If the transaction is signed by peers such that the endorsement policy is satisifed, then the transaction is deemed as one that passed the endorsement policy.\nMVCC(Multi version concurrency control) - A transaction that read keys during its execution, records their versions, and then upon commit the peer checks that the versions didn't change, so the causality of the data still remains intact.","266":"You have accidentally stumbled upon one of ethereum's lesser known \"features\".

After checked some related issues and docs, the temporary solutions for me is restart the peer which you found Failed to invoke chaincode name \"qscc\" at its log:\ndocker restart <peer container's id>\n\nHowever, this solution cannot solve the problem completely. But you can check this issues to get more information( the issues is duplicated by this and it's still unresolved).\nHere is a related comment by Manish Sethi for explaing what happends behind querying ledger:\n\nLedger exposes two set of APIs one set of APIs relate to state reads and manipulation and the other set of APIs relate to querying the blockchain status (such as GetBlockByNumber and GetTransactionByID). The first set of APIs are exposed via transaction simulator and (are meant for a chaincode to use during transaction simulation) and the second set of API are exposed as a direct APIs in the ledger interface (and are meant for clients to know the ledger status).\nKeeping the above in mind, a tacit assumption in the ledger design has been that a single gorouting limits it's usage to one of the above set of APIs exclusively. A chaincode limits itself to state related APIs and a ledger status querying client would not need to create a simulator.\nHowever, on the higher layers, since the ledger status related APIs are exposed via chaincode (qscc, to be specific), the above assumption is broken. The execution path for answering the ledger status queries obtains a transaction simulator before it reaches the qscc code (which has no use in fact, of the transaction simulator).\nMore specifically, an additional constraint on these two sets of APIs relates to the fact that two independent external calls to any of the ledger API should give a perceived notion of atomic commit to the block storage and the state. For instance, this should not happen that a client queries the API GetBlockchainInfo and finds out that block number 10 is committed but when he submits a subsequent state query, the query returns the state as of block 9 (because, the state update for block 10 are still pending). This is implemented by a pair of locks One lock syncs the state between simulation and statedb commit and another syncs the ledger status related calls with the overall commit. This is done for achieving better performance by halting the simulation to a minimum (only when the updates are actually been dumped to the disk) at the cost of ledger status related queries. Because, the qscc takes a transaction simulator, the above mentioned interaction leads to the reported deadlock. I believe that going forward, one of the suggestions was to expose these ledger status related APIs via grpc interface which will fix this issue. However, I list below three options for completeness...\nqscc path not to take hold of a transaction simulator (which is desired otherwise also, as the transaction simulator is an expensive resource as it takes a read lock on the statedb to sync with commit and hence should be taken only for transaction simulations).\nAn alternate fix could be to implement the above mentioned perceived notion of atomic commit to the block storage and the state by a coarser level single lock but that will impact the throughput an not a desired solution.\nImplement the perceived notion of atomic commit yet differently.. which requires some significant work in the interaction between ledger storage and the statedb. In nut shell, exposing the ledger storage a two phase commit. In first step, we append the block and then in the second step, update the BlockchainInfo and blockindexes sunchronized with statedb updates.\nGiven, the above, since the first one is anyway desired, my suggestion would be fix that for 1.1 and 1.2.","282":null,"283":"Take a look at the Corda Samples page.

In a transaction, it cannot be faked: you must have the private key associated with the given account. But in a call, you are free to set the sender to any value you like.\n\nSetting the Sender\n\nHow you set the sender depends on what tool you are using to call.

In a quick search, I didn't find anything about how to set the sender.

But you can supply a different method that takes an address as an argument. Then tools like MyEtherWallet will allow you to set the address of interest. For example:\n\nfunction getLink(address account) public view returns(string){\n    if(tokenBalances[account] > 0){\n        return link;\n    }else{\n        return \"You need to purchase a token at first...\";\n    }\n}\n\n\nHiding Data\n\nIt's worth noting that hiding data by checking msg.sender is useless.

In order to interact with a business network you need an identity that is authorised by hyperledger fabric to do so.\n\nIn Composer there is no such thing as a network administrator (ie a single participant or set of participants that have overall authority). All access for ANY participant is controlled by the acl definitions that a defined by the business network. The ability to change the business network (and thus the acls) are controlled by the identity who is allowed to perform a hyperledger fabric chaincode upgrade (or start if doing first deployment).\n\nComposer provides a very simple hyperledger fabric setup for development purposes only as well as a sample ACL that grants a predefined participant type of NetworkAdmin (perhaps this built in default name is confusing as it isn't anything special) allowing it full access to everything. Also in all the tutorials everything is referred to admin and setup that way in order to provide an easy entry into developing business network applications and certainly isn't a guide or representation of how a production network should be set up.\n\nIn conclusion, hyperledger composer is bound by whatever capabilities hyperledger fabric has for access (and note that more capabilities to hyperledger fabric are being introduced such as zero knowledge proof). Composer then adds on to this it's own concept of access control governed by the ACL definition, using all of these capabilities you have complete control over what identities and participants can do and see within a hyperledger fabric ledger.","380":null,"381":null,"382":null,"383":null,"384":null,"385":null,"386":"I think I got the answer.\n\n\n  It is not currently possible to return values from functions which\n  modify the blockchain.

And then the same to be consistently synchronized across all participants in the network, through a collaborative process. So this process which ensures correctness in order and data synchronization - is called consensus\n\nHLF Standard definition is \n\n\n  The process of keeping the ledger transactions synchronized across the network \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to ensure that ledgers update only when transactions are approved by the appropriate participants, and that when ledgers do update, they update with the same transactions in the same order \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is called consensus\n\n\nThis is done across the entire transaction cycle in the following ways\n\n\nWhen you are submitting the transactions, i.e, when you invoke a function in the smart contract, the Client SDK which you are using has to send that transaction proposal to the endorsers ( specific to that smart contract in the specific channel ) This transaction proposal is takes the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cryptographic credentials to produce a unique signature\nEndorsing peers do their share of checks, like proposal is valid, user who has attempted the transaction has the privilege for the same in that channel etc  . And then they would simulate the transaction - and creates a response and R\/W set. This is sent as proposal response which comes back to SDK.\nSDK accumulates them and checks them and then sends them out to the orderer. Orderer will order the transaction as per time and creates a block and sends the block out to all the peers in the relevant channel\nPeers who receive the block starts inspecting each transaction in the block (using Validation System Chaincode), to see endorsement is done for all of them & r\/w set is proper ( MVCC check). Depending on the checks, the transactions may be marked valid or invalid\n\n\nSo once all the checks are ok, the transaction is marked valid and current state is updated, and finally the blocks is written and events are generated accordingly.

While the former is a hash algorithm, the latter is a pseudo random generation algorithm (that uses SHA1 to update its internal state, of course.) One trivial result of this difference is, SHA1 outputs a fixed size of bits, where SHA1PRNG outputs as many bits as you like.\nBecause of this difference, SHA3-512 cannot be used as PRNG directly, although it is available in Java. What you need to do is, implement a PRNG algorithm using SHA3-512 (this part is really tricky, since generating a pseudo random stream is quite difficult.) and register it through your custom Security Provider (like Bouncy Castle does) with some name MySHA3PRNG. After that, you can get an instance of it with name MySHA3PRNG as you do for SHA1PRNG.

What you'll get is a PRNG based on a cryptographic hash function\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 with the usual security implications.\nFor example: the paper explicitly states that you should reseed regularly with sufficient entropy to prevent an attacker from going backwards on the period of the PRNG (which is probably what you've been hearing about).\n\nHowever, what you need is a PRNG algorithm that does not need to be re-seeded.

No, data on a blockchain won't ever be deleted. A deletion is just another transaction saying certain data is deleted, so that the world state database (the DB with the non-deleted info) can remove that data. \n\nSince a blockchain is a Merkle Tree in the background (or maybe a Hashgraph...), it plays by those rules and is immutable. Data will always be there unless the ledger and transactions are removed from the machines, such as restarting the network and removing all the information from the peers. That's basically a wipe of every machine that was used for the network structure holding the ledger. For Bitcoin that's everyone, for permissioned blockchains that may only be a few machines and could reasonably happen. \n\nHowever, that's in theory, and it gets a little complicated with different implementations of a blockchain. It sounds like you're using Hyperledger Fabric, so let's take that as an example. If you're upgrading the Business Network Definition for your network dynamically and your asset definitions changed and won't support existing assets in the registry, are they actually deleted? I'm not sure, but I know they won't show up in a query, which might be effectively the same. Similarly, if you set an ACL rule or use encryption, then a marked asset might as well be deleted, since there will be many barriers (see the docs on Security and Access control) for a random participant to view that data.

This may not necessarily be an answer to your question. But I wanted to post it as an answer, as a comment does not allow me to express the below that easily.\n\nmutable struct Blockchain\n    chain::Array{Dict{String, Any}}\n    current_transactions::Array{String}\n    block::Dict{String, Any}\n    new_block::Function\n\n    function Blockchain(chain::Array{Dict{String, Any}}, current::Array{String})    \n        new(chain, current, new_block(previous_hash=1, proof=100)) \n        # ^issue calling function within the constructor here\n    end\nend\n\n\nHere, I assume that you are trying to add some member function functionality to your struct, as you have already stated that you are coming from a C++ background. However, this is not Julian. In Julia, as @crstnbr has already suggested, we need to define global functions that act on objects. The convention is that you add ! at the end of the function to indicate that the function will be changing at least one of its arguments.\n\nThen, by checking the definition of your new_block:\n\nfunction new_block(proof::String, previous_hash::String=nothing)\n    block = Dict(\n    \"index\" => length(chain) + 1, # which chain?\n    \"timestamp\" => time(),\n    \"transactions\" => current_transactions, # which current_transactions?\n    \"proof\" => proof,\n    \"previous_hash\" => previous_hash | hash(chain[end]), # which chain?\n    )\n    current_transactions = []\n    append!(chain, block) # which chain?\n    return block\nend\n\n\nI notice a couple of serious mistakes. First, there are some undefined variables that you try to use such as chain and current_transactions. I assume, again from C++, you have thought that new_block would be a member function of Blockchain, and hence, could see its chain member variable. This is not how Julia works. Second problem is how you try to call new_block:\n\nnew_block(previous_hash=1, proof=100)\n\n\nThis call is totally wrong. The above call notation relies on keyword arguments; however, your function definition only has positional arguments. To be able to support keyword arguments, you need to change your function definition to read as below:\n\nfunction new_block(; proof::String, previous_hash::String=nothing)\n  #                ^ note the semi-colon here\n  # ...\nend\n\n\nAnd last, you define proof and previous_hash to be of type String, but call them with 1, 100 and nothing, which are of type Int, Int and Void.\n\nI could not understand your design choice for the Blockchain application in your mind, but I strongly suggest that you should go step-by-step with simpler examples to learn the language. For instance, if you just try the below examples, you will understand how type annotations work in Julia:\n\nMain> f(s::String = nothing) = s\nf (generic function with 2 methods)\n\nMain> f()\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Void)\nClosest candidates are:\n  f(::String) at none:1\n  f() at none:1\nStacktrace:\n [1] f() at .\/none:1\n [2] eval(::Module, ::Any) at .\/boot.jl:235\n\nMain> g(s::String) = s\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\nMain> g(100)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching g(::Int64)\nClosest candidates are:\n  g(::String) at none:1\nStacktrace:\n [1] eval(::Module, ::Any) at .\/boot.jl:235\n\nMain> h1(var1 = 1, var2 = 100) = var1 + var2\nh1 (generic function with 3 methods)\n\nMain> h1(var2 = 5, var1 = 6)\nERROR: function h1 does not accept keyword arguments\nStacktrace:\n [1] kwfunc(::Any) at .\/boot.jl:237\n [2] eval(::Module, ::Any) at .\/boot.jl:235\n\n\nOne last comment is that as far as I can see from your example, you do not need mutable struct. struct should simply help you with your design --- you can still add to\/modify its chain, current_transactions and block variables. Check, again, the simpler example below:\n\nMain> struct MyType\n         a::Vector{Float64}\n       end\n\nMain> m = MyType([1,2,3]);\n\nMain> append!(m.a, 4);\n\nMain> m\nMyType([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n\n\nYou can think of MyType's a variable, in the above example, as being double * const a in C++ terms. You are not allowed to change a to point to a different memory location, but you can modify the memory location pointed-to by a.\n\nIn short, you should definitely try to learn the language from the official documentation step-by-step, and post questions here involving really minimal examples. Your example is convoluted in that sense.","747":"If you want to follow the tutorial as is, you need to address step 1 before moving on to step 2 (you can run the example with just Truffle, but the steps are different).

Now to the use cases...\n\nToken Holder A -> Token Holder B :\nIn this scenario, Holder A wants to transfer some tokens to Holder B. If you sign a transaction using private key of holder A, then you can simply call the transfer function on contract at contractAddress. And this is what you are doing by sending transaction in below code (which will work if myAddress has a balance of tokens above noOfTokens in contract at contractAddress)\n\n            var rawTransaction = {\n                \"from\": myAddress,\n                \"nonce\": \"0x\" + lastCountOfTransaction.toString(16),\n                \"gasPrice\": web3.utils.toHex(1 * 1e9), \/\/1 can be changed to n gwei\n                \"gasLimit\": web3.utils.toHex(1000000), \/\/ 1000000 can be to set to any n number\n                \"to\": contractAddress,\n                \"value\": \"0x0\",\n                \"data\": ContractObject.methods.transfer(userAddress, noOfTokens).encodeABI(),\n                \"chainId\": chainId\n            };\n\n\nToken Holder A -> Token Holder B via Address C :\nIn this scenario, Address C wants to do a transaction on behalf of Holder A. As such the standard function to call is transferFrom. Assuming that some sort of approval has been given from Holder A to Address C, and that myAddress refers to Address C, you can use the below transaction\n\n            var rawTransaction = {\n                \"from\": myAddress, \/\/ refers to Address C\n                \"nonce\": \"0x\" + lastCountOfTransaction.toString(16),\n                \"gasPrice\": web3.utils.toHex(1 * 1e9), \/\/1 can be changed to n gwei\n                \"gasLimit\": web3.utils.toHex(1000000), \/\/ 1000000 can be to set to any n number\n                \"to\": contractAddress,\n                \"value\": \"0x0\",\n                \"data\": ContractObject.methods.transferFrom(userAddressA, userAddressB, noOfTokens).encodeABI(),\n                \"chainId\": chainId\n            };\n\n\nThis is as far as ERC20 goes. Refer https:\/\/theethereum.wiki\/w\/index.php\/ERC20_Token_Standard for more info.\nWhat you are doing feels like minting, and ERC20 doesn't standardize that. \nWhat you can do here is that setup an owner of the contract and use a modifier like onlyOwner for a mint function in the contract. Such a mint function can look something like\n\nfunction mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) onlyOwner canMint returns (bool) {\n    totalSupply = totalSupply.add(_amount);\n    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_amount);\n    Mint(_to, _amount);\n    return true;\n}\n\n\nThis way you can call the mint function from myAddress (if that address is the owner) and pass the userAddress who should receive the tokens. You can also choose to keep an upper limit and make the tokens capped by introducing check in the mint function or by adding an additional modifier (like canMint) to it. You can check out https:\/\/solidity.readthedocs.io\/en\/develop\/contracts.html#function-modifiers for more info on modifiers.","753":null,"754":"Anything's possible.\n\nBut assuming the basic security of the blockchain is intact, no, nothing but the smart contract itself is allowed to modify its storage.","755":null,"756":null,"757":"I resolved this issue by downloading the latest version of the binaries (v1.1.0-alpha ->v1.0.6).","758":"As far as I can understand your question, you wish to return some values from a transaction. \n\nAssuming that the transaction is of Invoke Type (not query) then whatever you are returning from the chain code (for example shim.Success(someData);, it will be part of your transaction payload.)\n\nSo, in order to get that transaction payload from the transaction, you have to make sure its committed to the peer's ledger.\n\nTo be sure, just before you submit the transaction, you can subscribe to the transaction event using the given transaction id) \n\n\nRef:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric-samples\/blob\/release\/balance-transfer\/app\/invoke-transaction.js#L90\nEventHub : https:\/\/fabric-sdk-node.github.io\/EventHub.html\n\n\nOnce you receive this event you can be sure that your transaction is successfully committed in the peer.\n\nYou can use the same transaction ID you can query a peer for the transaction block.\n\n\nRef : https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric-samples\/blob\/release\/balance-transfer\/app\/query.js#L95\nChannel.queryTransaction : https:\/\/fabric-sdk-node.github.io\/Channel.html#queryTransaction__anchor\n\n\nOnce you get the transaction payload in JSON you can dig into the JSON and find the return value in proposal response part of the JSON payload.\n\n[P.S.

Bitcoin mining itself is the process of adding new bitcoin transactions to the blockchain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions.  A new block of bitcoin transactions is added to blockchain every 10 minutes and has been since bitcoin was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.   Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, the bitcoin miner who successfully added the block is awarded newly generated bitcoins AND all the mining fees from people who sent a bitcoin transaction during that 10 minutes.

At the time of writing, more than 3 out of every 4 bitcoins that will ever exist has already been mined, and the annual inflation rate is just 4%. The block reward given to miners is made up of newly-created bitcoins plus transaction fees. As inflation goes to zero miners will obtain an income only from transaction fees which will provide an incentive to keep mining to make transactions irreversible.\n  \n  Due to deep technical reasons, block space is a scarce commodity, getting a transaction mined can be seen as purchasing a portion of it. By analogy, on average every 10 minutes a fixed amount of land is created and no more, people wanting to make transactions bid for parcels of this land. The sale of this land is what supports the miners even in a zero-inflation regime. The price of this land is set by demand for transactions (because the supply is fixed and known) and the mining difficulty readjusts around this to keep the average interval at 10 minutes.\n  https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Controlled_supply#What_happens_when_all_the_bitcoins_are_mined.3F","800":null,"801":"Possibly, it is block_voting.sol.

You shouldn't ask it once for an address, and then give that address out to everyone so they can send you money if you want to track senders and separate them.

I think your problem will be solved if you stop the current network , spin up a new one and install the chaincode there\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Tanmoy Krishna Das\n                \n                Nov 23, 2018 at 12:49,Ok Tanmoy.

Once a validator signs and transmits a validation, it cannot prevent any honest node from passing that validation to any other honest node, proving its past commitment.

It requires the honest nodes to have the capability to check past validations should they encounter a situation where that seems necessary. For example, directly-connected nodes can share their current tip hash. If they conflict, they could exchange information to see who is \"wrong\" and, in the process, might discover treachery.

Miners have full freedom. They may decide to not include any transactions in block. They can include only transactions which satisfy some criteria, for example fee per byte is greater then some value. They can include all transactions even without fee. Maximum block size is just limiting how many transaction bytes they can include. If non-confirmed transaction pool is greater than limit, then the most profitable way for miner is to include only transactions with big fee.

Lastly, do you know why I can work with web3.eth..sendAsync that returns CompletableFuture<EthBlock> ?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0devyJava\n                \n                Jul 8, 2018 at 1:14,I believe the IntStream solution only uses some finite amount of threads whereas the ExecutorService solution uses one thread per task (and caches them for re-use).

I meant to ask web3j provide an implementation of async as given here. Instead of using web3.eth...send(), I can use it's async method to return a CompletableFuture<EthBlock> object. From the code you gave me, it works and it's fast but it totally ignores the async implementation provided by the library.

My problem is something more practical: I literally have two machines, machine A and machine B with the DAPP loaded, and when some JavaScript code is executed on machine A (say, showing a graph, show the balance, etc.) the callback is executed on both the machines, so both machine A and machine B load the result (even if I clicked nothing on machine B).

I obviously completely misunderstood your question then. Sorry about that. It's hard to say for sure what's going on without looking at the client code. I can unbox their example and take a look (but I don't know what changes you've made, if any). The clients may be using the same address to retrieve data from the contract, or they may both have an identical event watcher setup to update the UI.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Adam Kipnis\n                \n                Apr 5, 2018 at 16:49,And I'm realizing you're talking about a completely different client than what is packaged with the tutorial. You can have a contract that emits events and setup your clients identically to respond to those events. However, a constant contract call (ie, balance retrieval) cannot emit events (emitting an event can only be done in a transaction). I don't think I can provide more help without a more specific issue and code. But, it doesn't seem like this has anything to do with Truffle or smart contracts and is an issue with your client.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Adam Kipnis\n                \n                Apr 5, 2018 at 17:24,If you feel like taking a look at what's going on, you can download the pet shop example tutorial I linked in my question.

If you want to show something like the maximum number of tokens a user can buy, you would divide the balance by the price. If you're executing the buy action in your smart contract, you would divide the amount sent to the contract (msg.value) by the price.

Than currently it transfer from owner to that address using contract. I want to transfer from contract instead of owner.

Now, if I understand you correctly, then you would like to ability to transfer the \"coins of contract\" to some address. If that is the case then you can modify my previously provided mint function and replace totalSupply = totalSupply.add(_amount); with balances[this] = balances[this].sub(_amount); to achieve the effect.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0RKalra\n                \n                Mar 14, 2018 at 20:55","753":null,"754":"Hi @smarx My question basically is: Is there any mechanism to let miner realize that contract content been changed illegally?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Yudao Yan\n                \n                Mar 8, 2018 at 5:15,Contract storage can only be changed via a transaction.

The big problem, however - is if you need lots of endorsements for a single transaction - the peers have to verify the ECDSA signature of all of these endorsements, which is costly.  Also - each endorsement includes in it, the peer's identity which when using the standard native MSP - is an x509 based identity which is ~ 700 bytes and therefore makes transactions balloon in size.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0yacovm\n                \n                Feb 13, 2018 at 19:05","807":null,"808":null,"809":null,"810":null,"811":null,"812":null,"813":null,"814":"In transferFrom, can B send this money to someone else like C?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0EresDev\n                \n                Aug 21, 2021 at 20:47,Yes, B can send token to C in that case. @EresDev\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Rabiul Islam\n                \n                Jun 1, 2022 at 17:58","815":"Thanks for your response, I done signup on infura and got some urls from infra.

While revoking write permissions and locking out the admin might seem like enough, it won't protect the hard drives from being directly overwritten (maybe with noise).

Hence, some external storage is necessary to store bigger\nobjects. This is where the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) comes into the\npicture. The Ethereum Dapp can hold a small amount of data, whereas for\nsaving anything more or bigger such as images, words, PDF files, and so on,\nwe use IPFS.\nIPFS is an open-source protocol and network designed to create a peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing data. It is similar to Bit Torrent.\nIf you want to upload a PDF, Word, or image file to\nIPFS.\n1-  You put the PDF, Word, or image file in your working directory.\n2- You inform IPFS to add this file, which generates a hash of the file. Note an IPFS hash always starts with \u00e2\u0080\u009cQm....\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n3- Your file is available on the IPFS network.\nNow you uploaded the file and want to share the file with Bob. you send the hash of the file to Bob, Bob uses the hash and calls IPFS for the file. The file is now downloaded at Bob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end. The issue here is that anyone who can get access to the hash will also be able to get access to the file.\nSharing Data on IPFS by Asymmetric Cryptography\nLet' say you uploaded a file to IPFS and you want to share it only with Bob.\n\nBob will send you a public key. you will encrypt the file with Bob's public key and then upload it to IPFS network.\n\nYou send the hash of the file to Bob.

better way of dealing with files on the blockchain is to use some sort of file storage services like AWS-S3, IPFS, Swarm, etc.\nYou can upload the files to one of the above file storage servers and generate the hash key(Which is used to access the file), and keep this key in the blockchain.\nThe advantages of using this method are -\n\nLow-cost solution\nEasy and fast access to files using file storage searching algorithms\nLightweight\nFlexibility to move from blockchain to DB or vice-a-versa\nIf the file storage system has good security from tampering, then be assured as these files will not be accessed without the right hash key\nEasy to perform migration of file storage from one service to
