I want something a researcher in business could understand and get the general picture in a certain depth.","1":"I'm adopting the Hyperledger Fabric to build applications for my business. \n\nSince permissioned blockchains like Fabric rely heavily on the PKI for identity management, and the fact that every transaction on the network requires signatures from participating components along way the transaction flow and transactions with those signatures finally got immutably persisted in the ledger. \n\nI wonder what happens if participating components would have to renew their certificates? For example, the original certificates expired or private keys got compromised.\n\nSpecifically, I want to know:\n\n\nShould renewal of a certificate require a new PKI key pair in best practice, or should a new certificate be created with the original key pair be created with its validity extended?\nWhat if it's the case when a private key got compromised, and I have to revoke the original certificate and use a new one with a new key pair. In this case, how should I validate signatures of transactions that were already persisted in the ledger? I wonder if it means that even if a certificate were revoked, it should be kept for validating history signatures.","2":"I'm trying to setup a simple Fabric network with the following:\n\n\nOrderer Organization [abccoinOrderers]\nSample Organization [ABC]\n\n\nAfter generating the all the necessary files using cryptogen tool, running the configtxgen command gives the following error:\n\nstudent@abc:~\/Desktop\/fabric\/network$ configtxgen -profile DefaultBlockOrderingService -outputBlock .\/config\/genesis.block -configPath $PWD\n    2019-12-26 12:35:42.131 MST [common.tools.configtxgen] main -> WARN 001 Omitting the channel ID for configtxgen for output operations is deprecated.

I created a script to evaluate the CPU and RAM consumption on the server, and observe the result in the image CPU and RAM consumption.\n\n\nIn addition, I took the system analyzed with the HTOP tool, and even the SWAP was fully consumed, as illustrated in this figure that shows the consumption moments before the error occurred.\n\n\nIn the Faq (https:\/\/sawtooth.hyperledger.org\/faq\/validator\/) of doubts, I found the following statement:\n\n\n  Sawtooth stores the blockchain in a LMDB database at\n  \/var\/lib\/Sawtooth\/block-00.lmdb . The LMDB database is a \"sparse\" file\n  meaning no storage is allocated for the file until it is used (written\n  to). The database should not run out of memory, as long as filesystem\n  storage is available. The memory error could happen in Kubernetes or\n  Docker or other virtual machine environments where there are no\n  storage volumes mapped to the VM.\n\n\nSince I am running my three validators in docker containers on the same server machine, I imagine the problem is that transactions are not being stored on disk but remain in RAM because of LMDB.\n\nHow to solve this problem?","7":"I am trying to deploying Contract on Ropsten test network using infura, metamask, Web3.

Customized the chaincode and the folder structure, and it all seems to compile and fire up just fine. But now, I am trying to find out whether I can use function Contract.submitTransaction() (found in invoke.ts and covered in the docs) or a more applicable function to pass somewhat more complex arguments for custom type Shipment which is based on type Car of the original example. In the example, Car is simply a flat type of strings, which you can simply pass to Contract.submitTransaction(), which takes only string arguments, like so:\n\nawait contract.submitTransaction('createCar', 'CAR12', 'Honda', 'Accord', 'Black', 'Tom');\n\n\nWith a type Shipment composed of multiple \"sub-types\", that gets a little harder:\n\nimport { TransitStatusEnum } from \"..\/enum\/transitstatusenum\";\nimport { FreightContainer } from \".\/freightcontainer\";\nimport { Company } from \".\/company\";\n\nexport class Shipment {\n    public docType?: string;\n    public id: string;\n    public status: TransitStatusEnum;\n    public containers: FreightContainer[];\n    public shipper?: Company;\n    private totalShipmentValue?: number = 0;\n\n    constructor() {\n        if (!this.containers) {\n            console.log(\"Shipment does not (yet) contain any containers, shipmentValue is 0\");            \n            return;\n        }\n\n        for (let container of this.containers) {\n            this.totalShipmentValue += container.transitAgreement.cargoValue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nBelow you'll find the function that Contract.submitTransaction() should invoke instead of CreateCar():\n\npublic async createShipment(ctx: Context, id: string, status: TransitStatusEnum, shipper: Company, containers?: FreightContainer[]) {\n    console.info('============= START : Create Shipment ===========');\n\n    const shipment: Shipment = {\n        docType: 'shipment',\n        id,\n        status,\n        containers,\n        shipper\n    };\n\n    await ctx.stub.putState(id, Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(shipment)));\n    console.info('============= END : Create Shipment ===========');\n}\n\n\nI could make factories for these self-defined types and have the types generated based on string values instead of types passed to createShipment(), or pass a stringified object (of objects\/arrays, of more objects\/arrays). But I'd like to know if (especially the latter, which gives me chills) is truly necessary. The docs only mention this Contract.submitTransaction() function as a way to submit a transaction to the blockchain.\n\nShould I go with my factory solution? Is there another function that I can use to be able to submit transactions using types?

organize the nodes of Hyperledger Fabric?\n\nBackground: we are building a commercial app using blockchain smart contracts based on Hyperledger Fabric platform. The architecture of the app expects some RESTful API web service (possibly in bound with some load balancing) accessing Hyperledger nodes and exposing the API to SPA Web UI. The web service API is proxying application requests to the another Hyperledger alloted RESTful API dedicated to node accessing and smart contract invocation rather then direct acces to the blockchain nodes from the app API. The customers access the facilities of smart contracts through the web UI (SPA). The requrements of Hyperledger are the options given by blockchain such as trust, confidence reliability, consensus and so on and required by the business logic. The main problem is hidden in node distribution.\n\nSo, the question is how to organize the nodes of the network if the users have only web access and main blockchain features are provided only in a distributed network. Maybe, you can suggest us some suitable solution or a direction to investigate? (besides IBM cloud platform and AWS)\n\nThank you.","129":"What steps are required in order to add an endorsing peer to a blockchain network (in hyperledger-fabric)?

Upon enrollment, we get a cert files under ~\/.hfc-key-store. \n\nNow I want to understand how should I go ahead with my flow. \n\nUser signs up on network:\n\nfabric_ca_client.register({enrollmentID: 'user1', affiliation: 'org1.department1'}, admin_user)\n\n\nUser log in with his secret:\n\n fabric_ca_client.enroll({enrollmentID: 'user1', enrollmentSecret: secret});\n}).then((enrollment) => {\n  console.log('Successfully enrolled member user \"user1\" ');\n  return fabric_client.createUser(\n     {username: 'user1',\n     mspid: 'Org1MSP',\n     cryptoContent: { privateKeyPEM: enrollment.key.toBytes(), signedCertPEM: enrollment.certificate }\n     });\n}).then((user) => {\n     member_user = user;\n     return fabric_client.setUserContext(member_user);\n\n\nInvoke\/Query as user1:\n\nvar store_path = path.join(os.homedir(), '.hfc-key-store');\nFabric_Client.newDefaultKeyValueStore({ path: store_path\n        }).then((state_store) => {\n            \/\/ assign the store to the fabric client\n            fabric_client.setStateStore(state_store);\n            var crypto_suite = Fabric_Client.newCryptoSuite();\n            \/\/ use the same location for the state store (where the users' certificate are kept)\n            \/\/ and the crypto store (where the users' keys are kept)\n            var crypto_store = Fabric_Client.newCryptoKeyStore({path: store_path});\n            crypto_suite.setCryptoKeyStore(crypto_store);\n            fabric_client.setCryptoSuite(crypto_suite);\n            \/\/ get the enrolled user from persistence, this user will sign all requests\n            return fabric_client.getUserContext('user1', true);\n        }).then((user_from_store) => {\n            if (user_from_store && user_from_store.isEnrolled()) {\n                console.log('Successfully loaded user1 from persistence');\n                member_user = user_from_store;\n            } else {\n                throw new Error('Failed to get user1.... run registerUser.js');\n            }..\n\n\nNow, what shall I do when a user logs out? delete the ~\/.hfc-key-store certs? Since these certs are going to be stored on server side where Node script is running, so it doesn't make sense.\n\nAlso, is my flow correct or if there is any better way to accomplice my objective?","198":"How to build the bridge between two different consensus blockchain platform?\n\n\nuse case:\n\n1.we need to ensure visibility of the transaction in both platforms to assure its integrity\n\n\nWhen a smart contract is established on one platform, that contract can be referred to, transacted and transferred to the other platform easily and securely\nThe bridge should be able to leverage the one platform and other platform depending upon the transaction type and the TPS requirement.

After a Timewindow the Bond + a defined fee has to be paid back.\nThe Application should be bound to a walletserver to validate transactions depending on whether payments have taken place.\nI want to have a website, where partys can login and see what kind of bonds are currently available and start transactions.\n\nSo after playing around a little i'm now completely confused about how to use corda properly to achieve this..\n\nAs far as i was told, offering Partys need to initially put their Offers on the Blockchain. So lets say Party A wants to sell 5000 Units with a 5% Fee, it would create a Transaction(basictransaction), with no inputstate which then is put on the ledger.\nIf Party B wants to buy 1000 Units of this, it needs to refer to this transaction and create a new one, which takes the basictransactions resultstate as inputstate.\nSo at this Point, if i understand the concept correctly, i would have 2 Outputstates. One for the actual Transaction, which holds the data for 1000 units bought, the fee, the duedate and the participating Partys.\nThe other one would be the updated basictransaction, containing the new amount of Units left to offer, so 4000.\n\nFirst question is, is this approach okay or is this a total nonsense? I'm completely unexperienced with this and have no idea or feeling yet for good or common practices.\nAnother question comming to my mind is, how does Party A make it its offer accessable for other Partys? Since all transactions are only visible for the participating Partys, the basictransaction wouldnt be visible for every other Party in the Network.\nMy Idea was to send the hash of the transaction to my webserver, which stores it and lists all Offers on my frontend. So if Party B logs in there will be a list displayed, containing available offers. B starts a transaction which means a Request is send to A, with the nessecary data(hash of basic, amount of units etc) and A then initializes the transaction with B.\nThis seems quite indirectly, i have no idea if this is secure and it leads to other problems.\nIn my Flow i would have to differentiate between the offering and the buying Party, because the buying Party only needs to sign the transaction it is involved in, not the update of the basic-transaction, which is updated in the webserver anyways. \nI have no idea yet how to achieve this, because if i put 2 outputstates in my transactionbuilder, i apply the same signing-conditions on both, if i split it into two transactions, the inputstate will be consumed after the first one and cant be inputstate for the 2nd transaction anymore..\n\nYa it seems i got a lot of things wrong in this, and i really would appreciate if someone could lighten this up a little for me.\nOf course i read the Docs and tutorials, but most examples are very basic and currently i'm not able to extrapolate this to my usecase.\n\nThanks in advance and sorry for my bad english :)","201":"I learned from here that it takes 6 blocks over a block for its contents to be confirmed.\n\nIf so, what is the chance that the latest block's contents are illegitimate?

I've Googled it but no luck. I'm guessing that I am supposed to use both the \"address\" and the \"password\" for that Ethereum account as parameters when calling the function but I have no idea how to do it. Function is called \"set()\" and it takes only 2 string values. \n\nHere is the part of Solidity code which makes the function \"set()\" accessible only by the owner of this contract.    \n\nconstructor() public {\n    owner = msg.sender;\n}\n\nmodifier onlyOwner() {\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\n    _;\n}\n\nfunction set(string memory _lastHash,\n             string memory _fullHash) public onlyOwner {\n    lastHash = _lastHash;\n    fullHash = _fullHash;\n}\n\n\nHere is the python function which i'm using to get the return values from the other 2 functions which i've not included:\n\ndata = contract.functions.getFullHash().call()\n\n\nFunction is called \"getFullHash()\".

If org1 somehow manages to get the peer details of of org2, org1 can commit transactions without having consent from org2?\nAnd what is the point of setting the user who is submitting the transaction to the HFClient? Where and how that user context and its enrolment validated by fabric in the transaction process?\nIdeally I would expect if I have AND ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer') as endorsement policy and have an UI to submit the transaction, the user context set in the HFClient should have the 'Org1MSP.peer' signature and the users in org2 with 'Org2MSP.peer' should get notified about the transation submitted. The transaction should be committed only when any user with signature 'Org2MSP.peer' signs it. And all these should happen irrespective of how many peers I have used to initialise the channel. Is my expectation valid? If so how to achieve it with fabric JAVA SDK?","257":"I want to create a consortium blockchain on the local environment using truffle and ganache or any other tools. \nThe problem is I am new to blockchain though I have created a public DApp by watching some tutorials I don't know how to start working any consortium app.\nAll I could found on some blogs are functional terms and how consortium works, not the implementation.

I have checked even the \u00e2\u0080\u009cswift\u00e2\u0080\u009d implementation and tried to use the class loader to load my file, but without success.\nI suppose, the file with encrypted sender\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wallet should be located on one of the following places:\n\n\ncorda-settler\/ethereum\/src\/main\/resources\/file.tmp\ncorda-settler\/cordapp\/src\/main\/resources\/file.tmp\n\n\n\nFinally I have hardcoded the location in that way:\n\n\n\/Users\/vladimirhristov\/WebstormProjects\/Corda\/corda-settler\/cordapp\/src\/main\/resources\/file.tmp\n\n\nand seems that the file was found but got another exception:\n\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError - screenshot\n\nSeems that the operation of wallet decryption is highly consuming, which breaks maybe the flow. There is an option to reduce the algorithm complexity of the wallet generation, which will reflect in lower resources required to decrypt the same wallet at the next step, but this will reduce the security as well.\n\nAnd here are my three basic questions ...\n\n\nHow could I specify (location\/mechanism) and make flow to find successfully my file, containing the sender\u00e2\u0080\u0099s encrypted wallet ?\nHow could I access a files in the flow, or if there is another mechanism to attach only the file with encrypted wallet and pass the decryption to core Corda ?\nDo I need just to increase node resources (tuning JVM params increasing -Xms\/-Xmx) in order to avoid OutOfMemoryError ?\n\n\nContent of the file (containing encrypted sender\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wallet):\n\nfile.tmp\n\n{\"version\":3,\"id\":\"ecb51768-8564-498a-bb11-3a5a5c8dc0bb\",\"address\":\"2bafc482bd227dfd5ba250521a00be3a4cc88bbd\",\"crypto\":{\"ciphertext\":\"e0511415792dfa7221ba1b8f32b8ec98e1410f45e612e2100df1aceddfdb22bd\",\"cipherparams\":{\"iv\":\"7ffa2af08f502c63d57e62440ad77539\"},\"cipher\":\"aes-128-ctr\",\"kdf\":\"scrypt\",\"kdfparams\":{\"dklen\":32,\"salt\":\"8051a5df1c02eb3eba81d2920fbb84b76b948a1248bbba62ffff684e733948cf\",\"n\":131072,\"r\":8,\"p\":1},\"mac\":\"be23fe0e261ba38892581d80afd0c86563748377b5cc702b6ed3285a13cceff6\"}}\n\n\nI will appreciate any help!

I have red many articles and saw many videos on what it is and how to implement it, but it seemed like some very vital questions remain unanswered to me. They would be the following:\n\n\nVery crucial: Where exactly is the DATA of the BLOCKCHAIN stored?\nOkay, so of course I know that every node in the chain has a copy of the ledger that is constantly updated. But this ledger, as far as my understanding goes, ONLY includes data about TRANSACTIONS, but not the actual data loaded into the blockchain? Or is this the same, since the BLOCKCHAIN can not store, say a \"video\" but only data about bitcoins transactions? \nEither way, that means that the public blockchain is getting bigger in size by the minute. When every node stores the whole blockchain, it is only a matter of time until it all crashes since no one has enough room to store everything anymore, right? \nRegarding smart contracts: It is my understanding that a smart contract is the only way to access the blockchain. If I wanted to set up my own blockchain, what I am doing is programming a smart contract that then accesses a server and loads data into the chain. Is this correct?\nHow many \"public\" blockchains exist? Is it just this one? Or is there one public blockchain for every topic? \n\n\nI hope you guys can bring some clearity into my questions!\n\nRegards,\n\nJ","275":"I am working on getting a transaction id info, which will give the peer details for the transaction.

These transactions update the state of the asset and maintain a trace as well.\n\nCurrently, if I want to have different transaction types for one asset, then I've written different functions in the chaincode which correspond to transaction types.\n\nFor example: If my assets are Cars, then each asset can have transactions of types sale, purchase, service, repair, etc. For each of these purchase, repair, service, etc., I've written a function in chaincode which gets invoked based on the type of transaction that is sent as input (type of transaction is sent as an argument in peer chaincode invoke command).\n\nDo you think this is a good approach? What do you follow? What is recommended to achieve different transaction types?\nAlso, how can I enforce different endorsement policies for different transaction types?\n\nNote: I'm aware of the asset based (or key based) endorsement policies (Fabric v1.4) that can be written in chaincode.

What is blockchain streaming, what problems does it solve and how is it any better than the normal way of doing it (file serving from the server)?\n\nI have done a small bit of research on Blockchain and I think I got the simple part of it. It's a way to store data in blocks which are chained together with their hashes. But didn't understand how it would be better for streaming. How is it better to store video data in block(s)? There's not much of a paper I could find about blockchain streaming other than the news of websites who use this.\n\nAlso, a small thing that came to my mind was bandwidth. I think the reason we don't see a lot of \"YouTube killers\" is because streaming uses a lot of bandwidth and it might be expensive. So I thought maybe this had something to do with the \"torrent\" or \"web torrent\" where users are the \"seeders\" and there's not much of a server cost but I don't think that would have something to do with blockchain.","326":"What I understand about blockchain is that:\nBlocks are secured by the hash.\nTransactions are secured by the markle-tree.\n\nDoes this mean that the markle-tree is not involved at all in securing the blocks?\n\nIf so, what prevents us from changing the transactions if we know the hash of older blocks in the chain?\n\nPlease note that I'm assuming that we are using a blockchain with only one node. And I want to know how hard it is to hack the blockchain in one node. Because as far as i understand, the hashing alone is very secure, but distributing the blockchain on multiple nodes will make it even more secure.","327":"I have chrome extension like Metamask, I am working on the private blockchain and developed the chrome extension wallet for this chain.

There would be a private state DB (aka. side DB) on each of these organizations and per my understanding, the side DB is just like a normal state DB which normally adopts CouchDB.\n\nOne of our main requirements is that we have to distribute files (e.g. PDFs) among some subset of the peers. Each file has to be disseminated and stored at the related peers, so a centralized storage like AWS S3 or other cloud storage \/ server storage is not acceptable. As the file maybe large, the physical copies must be stored and disseminate off-chain. The transaction block may only store the hash of these documents.\n\nMy idea is that we may make use of the private data collection and the side DB. The physical files can be stored in the side DB (maybe in the form of base64string?) and can be distributed via Gossip Protocol (a P2P protocol) which is a feature in Hyperledger Fabric. The hash of the document along with other transaction details can be stored in a block as usual. As they are all native features by Hyperledger Fabric, I expect the transfer of the files via Gossip Protocol and the creation of the corresponding block will be in-sync. \n\nMy question is:\n\n\nIs this way feasible to achieve the requirement? (Distribution of the files to different peers while creating a new block) I kinda feel like it is hacky. \nIs this a good way \/ practice to achieve what we want? I have been doing research but I cannot find any implementation similar to this. \n\n\nMost of the tutorial I found online pre-assumes that the files can be stored in a single centralized storage like cloud or some sort of servers, while our requirement demands a distribution of the files as well.

In the other machine I fetched the same channel config and join the same channel for both peers. \nI checked that all 4 peers in both machines have joined the same channel by below command - \n\npeer channel list\npeer channel getinfo -c mychannel\n\n\nNow from machine 1 I have installed and instantiated chaincode. This is working fine. Used below commands to install and instantiate - \n\npeer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -l golang -p github.com\/chaincode\/chaincode_example02\/go\/\n\n\n\npeer chaincode instantiate -o orderer.example.com:7050 --tls true --cafile \/opt\/gopath\/src\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/peer\/crypto\/ordererOrganizations\/example.com\/orderers\/orderer.example.com\/msp\/tlscacerts\/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem -C mychannel -n mycc -l golang -v 1.0 -c '{\"Args\":[\"init\",\"a\",\"100\",\"b\",\"200\"]}' -P \"AND ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')\"\n\n\nIf I query the chaincode from the same machine it is working fine and I am getting proper result. \n\npeer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{\"Args\":[\"query\",\"a\"]}'\n\n\nBut when I am executing the same chaincode query command from different machine it is giving below error - \n\n\n  Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:\"failed to execute transaction 2444b829db1485ad097b2e11442d65cb36f02de1c6a3f3372ad53594af4d1a4d: [channel mychannel] failed to get chaincode container info for mycc:1.0: could not get chaincode code: chaincode fingerprint mismatch: data mismatch\" \n\n\nI can see the hyperledger fabric is syncing all peers properly in both machines. Because when I run peer channel getinfo -c mychannel I can match the currentBlockHash, previousBlockHash and height value for all 4 peers. I am just not able to execute the peer chaincode query command from the other machine.\n\nWhen I run peer chaincode instantiate command I can see a new docker container is created in machine 1 which is for running chaincode. But there is no such container in machine 2. \nAm I missing any configuration here so that the chaincode container created on machine 1 can be accessed from machine 2?\n\n\n\nNew findings:\nI have installed chaincode on all 4 peers in both machines by running peer chaincode install command from the CLI container. I have two CLI container running in two machines. \n\nWhen I run the command peer chaincode list --installed. In machine 1 I get result like below \n\n\n  Name: mycc, Version: 1.0, Path: github.com\/chaincode\/chaincode_example02\/go\/, Id: 333a19b11063d0ade7be691f9f22c04ad369baba15660f7ae9511fd1a6488209\n\n\nWhen I run the same command in machine 2. The result is same except the Id value is different. But I also found that the Id value is same for both peers on same machine. Probably that's why I am able to execute the chaincode query from both peers on same machine. But not able to run it from other machine. Looks like that's the root cause of this problem.","465":"While generating the configtx peer block for Hyperledger Fabric Channel Creation in Amazon Managed Blockchain\nFacing an error\nCRIT 002 Error reading configuration:  Unsupported Config Type \"\"\nERRO 003 Could not find configtx.yaml.

Other users can see this data but they need a proof that data are real and not falsified by users or even by service.\n\nExample:\n\n\nUser A creates record with number 42\nCouple of months passes\nUser B see this record and wants to be sure that service can't update this record with any other number 37\n\n\nService has trust window with 24 hours: it even can change users data, which were made on this day.\n\nQuestion: Which instruments can help me to achieve that?\n\n\n\nI was thinking about doing public daily backups (or reports?) that any user can download. From each report hash will be calculated and inserted into next backup \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thus, a chan of hashes created. If service will change something in past, then hashes in this chain will not converge. Of course, i'll create open sourced tool for easy comparing diff between data and check if chain is valid.\n\nPoint of trust: there is one thing that i'm afraid of. Service can use many databases simultaneously and update all backups with all hashes one time (because first backup has no hash of previous one).

The application will depend on worldstate values, the applications will not traverse through blockchain to find a value.\n\nMy questions are:\ni) how frequetly the worldstate is recalculated ?\n\nii) will a broken chain(in case of a tamper) is detected while re-calculating the worldstate\n\niii) what if a suspect tampers the worldstate on a peer. how this situation is set right ? will the tampering be detected during the consensus or any other acticity ?\n\nI read and understood that the blockchain is tamper proof, but really want to understand which processes safe guard the BC ?","602":"When i try to import bitcore generated address it gives -5 error i,e. invalid multichain address or script.

I will be writing the thesis for a big accounting company and have basic knowledge of the technology and the situation in the blockchain- and crypto industry. \nNow, it would be great if someone could help me with suggestions you might have on this matter.\nThis accounting company is looking to use blockchain for data archival and transfer for mostly bookkeeping related documents. The storage at this point was something like 15 tb I believe and as they are looking for permanent storage this number will keep growing, so keep that in mind. \nAnother requirement is that the transfer of this data needs to be quick and easy for the clients. So I would imagine that in case of blockchain storage, the company holds the key to the data, and when the company wants to transfer the data it can give the key to the client, who can then download the data securely etc., (that would be the ideal scenario).\nIs this something that could potentially be achieved with platforms like Storj, Sia and Swarm? And might there maybe be other ways to achieve this (the company mentioned Azure for example)?\nAs I said, I have a basic knowledge, and hope to learn a lot more during the writing of my thesis, so forgive me if I said something that cringes your blockchain-heart! This is just purely to get a little more information so that I know which directions I can head to when researching this.\n\nAnd once again, sorry if I'm in the wrong place for this.\nThanks, and greetings from Finland.\n\nI have read about storage protocols like Storj, Sia and FileCoin. They offer blockchain storage, but I'm not entirely sure if this could be used on an enterprise level.\n\nI hope to get a little more insight into the possibilities by receiving suggestions from blockchain experts, or people that know more than me about blockchain technology","604":"I want to know how to reload a peer (or an orderer) after I reenrolled MSP from CA server.\n\nCurrently I do it with the following procedure.

But, let's say that I have a bank and I have millions of customers then, how we can manage these many processes?\n\nI know my questions are naive but I'm not able to find any solution to my queries.","618":"I implemented hyper ledger fabric network on single machine and I am worry about backup of ledger data.\nAs blockchain network is secure and transaction can not be altered but as a backed developer How can we secure data as backup ?","619":"I'm newbie to blockchain. we use hashing for algorithm for sealed numbers.actually sealed number is identified based on required hashoutput. who will identify these required hashoutput initially.","620":"Jussi docker has 28 steps to build the docker.\nI run the docker with steemit developer guide but it was not passed in unit test step 26.\nStep 26\/28 : RUN pipenv run pytest\n\nMy environment is as followings\nOS: Ubuntu 18.04\nPython: 3.6.5\nDocker: 18.09.1\n\nFollowing Error happened.\n\n ---> Running in 248a0ce440aa\n============================= test session starts ==============================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.6.5, pytest-3.10.0, py-1.7.0, pluggy-0.8.1\nrootdir: \/app, inifile: pytest.ini\nplugins: timeout-1.3.3, sanic-0.1.15, pylint-0.14.0, profiling-1.4.0, mock-1.10.0, docker-0.6.1, cov-2.6.0, console-scripts-0.1.7, asyncio-0.9.0\ncollected 3036 items\n\ntests\/test_account_transfer_route.py ......................

(possible many but I looking for simplicity)\nThere are many clients that are trusted and do CRUD operations on these data.\nA server (That can be realized by serverless architecture because it is needed only when a client requires it) that modifies these flat files on requests from clients or gives them current version of resources.\n\n\n\n\nI researched some hours and have a problem because found many complicated solutions like Paxos and Raft that requires network infrastructure. \n\nMy proposition\n\nSo I want to show my proposition and instantly ask if something similar exists and can be used in this case. Any feedback about problems with my concept will be appreciated.\n\nArchitecture.\n\nClients\n\nWe have many clients that can be disconnected from network, operate on local data and want to send their changes, receive changes made by other clients. \n\nData Storage\n\nWe have one data storage like AWS \/ Dropbox \/ Google Drive \/ Hosted files, does not matter, it is important that there is no access to such advanced and powerful tools like casandra. There are two files: current data - it can be serialized JSON or SQLite file and logs it is a file with the history of all operations sorted by timestamp.\n\nPoint of access\n\nWe have one point to access to this data. Serverless unit with the following tasks: receive local logs from the client, merge them with global logs, process them to update global current data, send to client instruction about a local modification that hi should apply.\n\n\n\nProcessing\n\nLet's consider the following scenario. A client modifies local data and adds any modification to local logs.\n\nSynchronization means. That\n1) A client is sending local logs to point of access (server). The server creates empty .lock file to prevent modification from other points of access. If the file was existing before, synchronization is refused. The server looks for the date of the last synchronization saved in the local log. Then download logs from storage and gets any lines from the date of the last synchronization to now. Server mixing them, and calculating two things: a) how to update global current data, b) how to update local current data of this client. Then the server download global data, apply modification. Send local modification instructions to the client. And removes .lock file. Client applies modifications modifying local state, remove local logs and save to them a date of the last synchronization.\n\nExceptions \/ Merging\n\nNow image that two clients deleted the same item.

If two clients update the same resource then we should look at his structure. I mentioned about JSON representation. So it is a collection of keys and values.

Can we have user configurable smart contract?\n\nExplanation: Let us say the entire logic changes due to business process change. In that case client will have to contact a solidity developer time and again whenever there is change in the process.\n\nOur idea is to give a UI (with drag and drop option) where user can set smart contract logic and that logic will be translated into solidity smart contract. \n\nMy question is that \"Is this approach feasible?\"\n\nIf \n\n\n  yes\n\n\nthen what are the libraries\/dependencies available to do this.\nIf \n\n\n  no\n\n\nthen what option do we have?

This is my first experience with something like this and I have no idea about this stuff. I read a lot about this on github sites about some of these platforms, mostly Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. I am very confused about what I have read is the need of an application generator, a code editor, containers such as dockers, something about APIs and REST servers, CLI tools, Frameworks, clients, libraries as node.js or npm...\n\nI know how Blockchain works but I do not have an idea of how to create it and start with it.\nSo I need a list of the vital tools because I did not find anything well explained for a beginner.\n\nThank you.","675":"I created a sample cordapp and started the flow and made some transactions successfully.

I'm not familiar with how does that work but after some research, I found something like below:\n\nIf we compare communication through web services in mobile client, then pretty much everything is same expect in Smart contract, is no database or deployment service as the result of decentralized nature of the system. Is that right? We can connect mobile client to smart contract using some library like web3 which would essentially work with Json RPC or websockets.\nBut what if I don't want to connect each mobile client to smart contract using library like web3? Instead, what if I want to have a HTTP server and then it would connect to smart contract like below?\n\nIs that possible? If yes, then how can I do that?\nMy second question is regarding deployment. In the centralized server scenario, I would have database deployed on some service like AWS etc. I could estimate the deployment cost. I understood that we have to deploy smart contract on Ethereum mainnet which will cost some x amount of Ether. But then I found out that my users will have to pay for each computation. What if I want to bear all the costs? How can we estimate such costs?","677":"I'm trying to find out if there is a way to get the address of the contract creator if I only know the contract address and the contract interface (ABI)?","678":"I have installed all the required components to run hyperledger composer locally on my PC.

How are you measuring latency? Is this client side? And, what region are you running in and what is your latency to that region?  The short answer is \"no\". But I will need more information to help you narrow down the problem.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Marc\n                \n                Dec 13, 2019 at 18:11\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Hi Marc, I'm running on the region us-west-2 from India. I'm measuring the latency at client-side using console.time(). I haven't done complete benchmarking yet, but this is what I'm getting for now. Will changing the region or the sdk from node to java affect the current latency?

Right now what you're measuring is the latency between your browser and us-west-2, not the latency of QLDB.

Essentially, I'm asking: what do we need to do to be confident that a record I am reading from one computer node is consistent with the clones on other nodes? More specifically, do I get record first, then check its consistency next? Or do I build a system that guarantees all nodes clone records properly first, then by the time I read, I can simply trust what I read is legit?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Morris\n                \n                Nov 8, 2019 at 9:55\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    2\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                That's correct except you are missing the part where nodes validate the data that was hashed. They do not blindly accept whatever data they receive based on the hash alone. If the transactions are invalid, missing proper signatures, or any of the other agreed upon consensus rules, then the nodes reject the new block, and the miner just wasted their resources mining that new block. Miners would quickly realize this is a waste of money or try to fork to a new chain.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0JBaczuk\n                \n                Nov 10, 2019 at 13:27\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    \n                \u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\n            Show 3 more comments","108":"2\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                i'm confused, it sounds like you are starting with blockchain and working backwards to make it work.

If you use discovery then the peers will have all roles by default unless they can be overridden (don't know on this one).

Typically it is more cost effective to sort off chain.  If I am understanding your example properly I would solve it by creating an array(public) of all addresses and a mapping of address => contribution.  Then off chain I would call to get the value of the array then for each entry, get the contribution and sort accordingly.

You may have to create a seperate gradle task to copy the files into the deployed nodes directory (if you are hoping to test locally)\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Nicholas Rogers\n                \n                May 21, 2020 at 17:24\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","273":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","274":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","275":"Are you specifically looking for the peer that did the transaction or the client\/member identity with which the transaction was signed and broadcasted for endorsing?

Why not just have your auth logic contact different database replicas as fallbacks in case any one of them fails to respond?

Well, any decentralized storage  technology necessarily has multiple replicas, so you can't escape that regardless :) You can also always have multiple auth servers for high availability, each of which can contact any replica. (This is how my workplace solves the same problem, with a K8s  service whose job it is to handle auth for all applications running multiple pods. Auth caches are handled via replicated Redis and Postgres.). It works. But I'll let the answers accumulate - just pointing out multiple auth servers + multiple replicas works.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Akshat Mahajan\n                \n                May 1, 2019 at 6:56\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @AkshatMahajan Yes you have a good point.

That's why we have private collection and private collection configuration where you mention the organizations who should have access to private collections. For every set of organizations you would be creating that many set of private collections and configurations.

Free materials are available at https:\/\/jbaczuk.github.io\/blockchain_fundamentals. Here is some info, if you have any specific questions about proof of work, please add it and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to answer for you.\n\nProof of Work\n\nProof of work is what a miner must provide with their block candidate in order for the network to consider that block valid. A proof of work is given as a 32 byte value which is calculated using the block data and a hash function, so it is called a block hash.\n\nFinding a valid block hash\n\nThis step is the process commonly referred to as mining. This is where the most work is done, and provides the basis for a secure network.\n\nBlock Hash\n\nThe block hash is created by taking the block header, and providing it as an input to the SHA256 hashing algorithm. The nonce is continually changed until a valid solution is found. Miners are, quite literally, optimized guessing machines hoping the next random nonce will result in a valid hash. The fastest, most power efficient hardware will be the most profitable. Power costs and air temperature in a given region will also affect mining profitability.\n\nHash Functions\n\nHash functions are one-way functions, meaning they can only be computed in one direction. You can easily hash an input, but you cannot calculate an input that will result in a specific output. In order to do so, you have to keep providing a new random input until the solution is found. In Bitcoin, this is also known as work, the number of guesses, on average, that a miner must make in order to calculate a valid hash.","1":"First of all, there are 2 types of certificates in Fabric:\n\n\nTLS certificates \nEnrollment certificates\n\n\nFor TLS certificates, when they expire - they cannot be used anymore but obviously active TLS connections aren't being terminated when it happens. \n\nFor enrollment certificates - when they expire they still keep on being useful regardless of their expiration. This is to prevent a fork when peers join the Blockchain late. So, in short - certificate expiration has no effect in enrollment certificates.\n\n\nShould renewal of a certificate require a new PKI key pair in best practice, or should a new certificate be created with the original key\n\n  \n  pair be created with its validity extended?\n\n\nIn most cases, Fabric treats 2 certificates with the same public key but different attributes as 2 completely different identities (unless you take into account de-duplication at transaction validation) so if you have a chance to renew a certificate of a node or a client - you might as well also use a fresh key. It is not required but it is possible. \n\n\n  What if it's the case when a private key got compromised, and I\n  have to revoke the original certificate and use a new one with a new\n  key pair. In this case, how should I validate signatures of\n  transactions that were already persisted in the ledger? I wonder if it\n  means that even if a certificate were revoked, it should be kept for\n  validating history signatures.\n\n\nFor TLS certificates, Fabric doesn't use CRLs so you can only rely on short expiration periods, or you can always just replace the entire certification chain and this would implicitly invalidate the leaf certificates of the old chain.\n\nFor Enrollment certificates you can issue a CRL config update to all channels and this would make it impossible to use the compromised key in future transactions, however signatures of transactions made in the past (in the blocks that precede the revocation of the certificate) would still be valid from obvious reasons.\n\nHowever, there is a code path that checks expiration of enrollment certificates: Whenever a request from a peer or a client is authenticated to access a resource (i.e a client wants to execute a chaincode, or a peer wants to pull blocks) - then the certificate expiration of enrollment certificates is also checked by the server (peer\/orderer).","2":"There are 2 errors in theconfigtx.yaml.  \n\n\nOrderer: Is a map type or object type, not an array or slice type.

For example, there are SDKs available for JavaScript (Node.js), Java, Go and Python. Furthermore the chaincode itself could be written in either JavaScript, Java or Go.\n\nTo stay language neutral, the internal representation of the arguments is just an array of bytes, which is defined in the protobuf specification which Fabric uses for internal communication. Fabric SDKs also tend to toss in a conversion to a string definition. Your only option is to work with bytes or strings. You could use your own custom parsing or for more advanced use, you could use some type of serialization protocol (see comparison). However, both your application and chaincode needs to support it.\n\nWhen you need to send objects, I would recommend creating a chaincode function such as createShipment for your case, which accepts as many arguments as needed to construct the object. If the object itself contains an array of objects (FreightContainer) you could register this as an object itself (createFreightContainer) which contains an ID to the Shipment.","16":"In the PoW systems, block signing is not needed, because of block ID id generating by hashing root of Merkle Tree (Merkle Root) of payload transactions and nonce, until hash become less than target.\n\nIf do analogous approach in PoS system, them malicious minter can generate lot of attempts with different output hashes from a same kernel UTXO (transaction output, which mints coins) - just by modify nonce and\/or rearrange transaction in Merkle Tree, there is lot of combinations. And by this way, he can reduce PoS to PoW (lot of hashing attempts with same data).\n\nTo prevent such degradation, PoS cryptos (PPC, EMC, etc) limits number of attempts for some specific UTXO. And hash result (which compared to a target) depends only from kernel UTXO and from current time, and independent from nonce, block payload, and so. As result, PoS minter can make a single attempt for each matured UTXO only once per second.\n\nBut, with this approach, block content is not participate in the kernel hash, which compares to target.  \n\nAs result, if minter does not sign a block, malicious actor can do following attack: He can intercept from the network a freshly-minted block from a minter, modify payload transactions and Merkle Tree and block hash (for example, add double spend TX), and redistribute the modified block over the network. Such block will contains valid coinstake transaction (which spends kernel UTXO), and will be accepted by network nodes.\n\nTo prevent this \"modify freshly-minted block on the fly\", block is signed by address of kernel UTXO.

In short, install Truffle's hd-wallet-provider\n\n$ npm install @truffle\/hdwallet-provider\n\n\nReplace truffle-config.js with\n\nconst HDWalletProvider = require(\"@truffle\/hdwallet-provider\");\nconst mnemonic = \"orange apple banana...\";\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  networks: {\n    ropsten: {\n      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, 'https:\/\/ropsten.infura.io\/v3\/<YOUR INFURA PROJECT ID>'),\n      network_id: 3,       \/\/ Ropsten's id\n    },\n  },\n\n  compilers: {\n    solc: {\n      version: \"0.5.11\",    \/\/ Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe previous code configures Truffle to connect to Infura an use your account.

Since the constructor couldn't be executed, your deploying transaction was reverted as well.\n\nInstead of manually creating your deploying transaction, you can use web3.eth.Contract.deploy. With this method you can conveniently provide all parameters required by the contract's constructor. \n\nUPDATE: The solution below won't work with Infura because the Infura API does not expose web3.eth.personal functions and it only allows sending rawTranscations.\n\nYou should be able to deploy your contract with the following code.

Both Fabcar and Commercial Paper have their different applications in their respective application folders.\nApplications can interact with our channel or say underlying fabric layer through a gateway. \n\n\n\n  The Hyperledger Fabric SDK provides a gateway abstraction so that\n  applications can focus on application logic while delegating network\n  interaction to the gateway. Gateways and wallets make it\n  straightforward to write Hyperledger Fabric applications. Find here in the docs\n\n\n\nOur applications require some identity to be able to use underlying fabric layer. This identity's authenticity is checked by gateway before allowing access to the network.\nFabric uses concept of keys and signed certificates to perform this authentication. \n\n\nDiving into a different concept here, fabric provides two kind of certification architectures (architecture might not be the correct word),\n\n\ncryptogen - generally used for developement or testing purposes to generate keys and certificates\nCertificate Authority - not a new concept, used by fabric to generate certificates. Any CA server requires to have admin to allow generating certificates.\nWhile bringing up the server itself, this bootstrap identity is created using fabric-ca-server start with a -b option with username:password parameter.  \n\n\nComing back to fabric, before starting any network (basic-network or first-network) fabric asks us to generate cryto-config.\n\n\nCommercial Paper uses certificates and keys generated by this previously generated crypto-config by cryptogen to generate identities for the application.\nFabcar uses CA to generate certificates and keys. Admin was registered already when we brought up our CA server container in Fabcar. We simply gave him certs and keys on enrollment. New user require both registration and enrollment (done using CA admin identity).\n\n\n\n  The private and public key are first generated locally and the public\n  key is then sent to the CA which returns an encoded certificate for\n  use by the application. These three credentials are then stored in the\n  wallet, allowing us to act as an administrator for the CA. Find here in the docs\n\n\nSo it's not by design of fabric why Fabcar used CA and why Commercial-Paper used cryptogen, it's simply by choice.\n\nI'll end my answer, quoting exact statement from the fabric documentation.\n\n\n\n  When we created the network, an admin user literally called admin\n  was created as the registrar for the certificate authority (CA).\n  Our first step is to generate the private key, public key, and X.509\n  certificate for admin using the enroll.js program. This process uses\n  a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the private and public key are\n  first generated locally and the public key is then sent to the CA\n  which returns an encoded certificate for use by the application.\n  These three credentials are then stored in the wallet, allowing us\n  to act as an administrator for the CA. We will subsequently register\n  and enroll a new application user which will be used by our\n  application to interact with the blockchain. Find here in the docs\n\n\n  addToWallet.js is the program that Isabella is going to use to load\n  her identity into her wallet, and issue.js will use this identity to\n  create commercial paper 00001 on behalf of MagnetoCorp by invoking\n  papercontract.

The extension can push data to the website, or the website can request data by doing message passing requests. Private keys are stored in the sandboxed local storage and requests are made from the website to the extension to sign messages. The extension returns the signed message to the website.\n\nWeb-based:\n\nBrowser-based crypto wallets such as Authereum, Portis, Torus, and Fortmatic, use sandboxed local storage as well via an iframe. Unlike cookies, local storage is strictly restricted by domain, meaning that if a website sets a value in local storage, then only that website can read the value; so alice.com cannot read bob.com's local storage. To sandbox local storage sensitive values, they are set under a controlled subdomain, for example x.wallet.com, since no other website will be able to read the local storage. This subdomain contains no UI is meant for iframed communication only. The web3 provider's of those wallets load a hidden iframe on the website, which is used to communicate to the subdomain containing the sandboxed storage; so for example Alice on dapp.com using Authereum, the Authereum sdk connects to x.authereum.org using an iframe and send postMessage requests to the iframe from the website to sign messages. This restricts the website from reading sensitive data such as private keys and only allow the website to send sign requests similarly to how wallet extensions work.\n\nNot all web-based wallets have sandboxed local storage so you should avoid using those since any website can read the stored sensitive data but the wallets mentioned here are safe in that regard.\n\nProtection against phishing attacks\n\nPhishing attacks occur when a user is tricked into thinking they are using a known website but instead are using a malicious website that resembles the legitimate website. Authereum, Portis, and Torus are username and password based login solutions so they open up the login auth window in a new popup or redirect. This allows the user to verify the domain of the website for legitimacy. Google auth does this pattern as well. Besides opening a new window on login for the user to verify, some web-based wallet providers also open a new window when signing messages and transactions to verify the request.\n\nClick jacking occurs when a website is loaded via an iframe on the website and the website overlays a different UI on top of the iframed website with pointer-events set to none and then tricks the user into entering information or clicking a button on the overlayed UI but they are actually clicking a button on the iframed website. This is dangerous because the action on the iframed website can be something like sending funds to the attackers wallet.\n\nTo prevent the wallet site to be loaded in an iframe at all, all the wallet site has to do is set the HTTP header X-Frame-Options: DENY, which is what Authereum and Portis are doing so they are safe from these attacks.\n\nTrusting content scripts\n\nIt's easy to verify browser extension source code by using source viewer plugins, but to avoid an extension from auto-updating with malicious code, a user can install the extension manually to lock it down to a version by getting the source code from github if it's open source or from downloading the source scripts.\n\nSince with web-based wallets the wallet site owner controls the content scripts then you have to trust that the content scripts managing the sensitive key data won't be malicious since the wallet site owner or an attacker that got access to the wallet site can at any point update the website source code with bad code. \n\nTo trust content scripts, the wallet site can be hosted on IPFS since the web address is the content hash meaning you can trust that it won't change. Authereum is one wallet that already offers this by visiting authereum.eth or by resolving the contenthash property of their ENS name.\n\nConvenience\n\nWeb-based wallets are portable because you can use the same wallet on any OS, browser, desktop or mobile, while with browser extension you are stuck with the environment you are using the extension from. Extensions are highly inconvenient but offer more storage isolation guarantees. With contract-based accounts however, more security features can be offered on the wallet side. \n\nContract-based accounts\n\nMetaMask, Portis, Torus, and Fortmatic are all externally-owned account based (EOA) which means that funds are stored and manged by a single key. If an attacker gains access to the signing key, then they also have access to the funds stored at that key. \n\nContract-based accounts (CBA), such as Authereum, provide more security guarantees because each account contract can have multiple keys to manage it and each key may also have limited authority over what actions it can do. \n\nAdvantages of contract-based accounts:\n\n\nFunds are not stored on a single key\nYou can cycle through management keys\nAccount recovery, in case your management keys are stolen or lost\nTransfer and withdraw limits \nAccess controls for keys, meaning you can restrict what methods a key can invoke","39":"Make sure you set the correct script for your utxo.\n\nvar utxo = {\n  \"txId\" : \"d095e2e921ac6f0ed5f7f886529c14d662b82feb35e1afa0051a8328855ecdf8\",\n  \"outputIndex\" : 0,\n  \"address\" : address.toString(),\n  \"script\" : \"76a9144093522294655efcbfc2bdfdb448682bf3bef69a88ac\",\n  \/\/ \"script\" : \"76a91447862fe165e6121af80d5dde1ecb478ed170565b88ac\",\n  \"satoshis\" : 100000,\n  \"network\":'testnet'\n};","40":"You can use truffle to interact with your smart contract or retrieve data from it.\n\nLet's say I have a contract looks like this:\n\ncontract MetaCoin {\n    mapping (address => uint) balances;\n\n    ...\n\n    function getBalance(address addr) public view returns(uint) {\n        return balances[addr];\n    }\n}\n\n\nYou can call function getBalance in your javascript code to get the balance of an address with the following code:\n\n\/\/ Interact with truffle contract instance\nlet balance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])\nbalance.toNumber()\n\n\nHere is a more detailed version: interacting with your contract\n\nHere is a brief tutorial on how to build a dapp with truffle: Pet Shop","41":"If you are really interested in learning and diving into Hyperledger Fabric, avoid byfn script.

The (0) is primary node of 1st BFT protocol instance and (1) is second primary node from second BFT protocol instance - something like backup of (0) as it is defined in RBFT protocol white paper.\n\n\nIs there some delay or why I needed to wait few minutes until (1) for Node2 disappeared.\n\n\nThe delay is a period of time until consensus with new backup BFT protocol instance is reached. The 1 should be assigned to another node. \n\n\nEven after 20+mins the (1) has not been assigned to any of the Reachable hosts. Why?\n\n\nMy current assumption is that until primary BFT instance is the same the consensus and RBFT \/ Indy-Plenum's RBFT doesn't run new \"election\" aka view-change for primary instance or \"round-robin\" assignment with BFT instances.

You can use the Managed Blockchain console to view the metrics for a peer node. Managed Blockchain also reports metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. You can use CloudWatch to set up dashboards, receive alarms, and view log files for peer node metrics.\n\n\nMetrics include:\n\n\nTransactions: The number of transactions that a peer node receives per minute.\nCPUUtilization(%): The percentage of total CPU capacity used on the peer node's Managed Blockchain instance at any given instant.\nMemoryUtilization(%): The percentage of total available memory used on the peer node's Managed Blockchain instance at any given instant.","103":"[Update]\n\nHere are unique benefits one can get with the Intel SGX alongside Hyperledger Sawtooth\n\nPoET Consensus in SGX mode: PoET is a scalable consensus algorithm, if it is configured to run in SGX mode then you get Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) feature. The other BFT algorithms do not scale up to work with larger networks. For example,  PBFT would require a fully connected network in place unlike PoET. Though PBFT is good enough for smaller networks (even 20 nodes).

A node will reject an invalid block.\n\nNow, the block could become invalid for a few reasons.\n\n\nIf a longer chain is presented, which can be validated. For example, if another miner has mined 2 blocks which replace the latest block, the node will accept them since there is more proof of work (each block has to be mined with a proof of work). This requires a majority of the network hashpower (computing power) and is also known as a 51% attack. The more blocks have been mined since the transaction occurred (aka number of confirmations), the more secure it will be from being reversed (or removed) in a reorganization or 51% attack. This is very very unlikely for Bitcoin because of how high the network hashrate is. It is much more likely for other coins which have a much lower network hashrate.\nA miner mines another block at nearly the same time (within seconds or less), Chain Reorganization. This could happen because of latency issues, for example. This is also unlikely because a block on average is mined every 10 minutes, and the network propagation is very fast, but probably much more likely than #1.

The entire purpose of blockchain was to be able to move value without relying on a third party who might censor\/block transactions, inflate the currency, become compromised, etc. Bitcoin is transparent (verifiable) and decentralized money available to anyone with a computing device and internet connection without restrictions based on your background, nationality, citizenship, or laws.\n\n\n  If I made a transaction in blockchain, does the bitcoin transfer occur only after adding the transaction into blockchain?\n\n\nA transaction on Bitcoin is not considered to be final until it has been included in a block. This is important because there are many reasons why it might not be included in a block:\n\n\nObviously if the transaction is invalid (the user doesn't have the Bitcoin to send, or it contains invalid signature or other invalid information)\nThe fee was too low, and it was rejected by the network\nIf the network is busy, the fee might be too low and it will not be selected by a miner for inclusion in the next block (they will pick transactions with higher fees so they make more money). After 2 weeks Bitcoin Core nodes will kick out stale transactions from the mempool (where they wait to be mined).\n\n\n\n  If so, it can take time to mine the block and urgent payment cannot be made. So isn't it a disadvantage of blockchain?\n\n\nThe bigger question here is how much security do you want? If you send someone Bitcoin and they don't even wait until it is included in a block (they see it in their mempool) and they give you the product or service you are buying, they are taking the risk that it might never be mined. Also, after it is included in a block, there is a very small risk of being invalid in the case of a reorganization, see Chain Reorganization. This could happen because of latency issues, for example.\n\nAnother risk is a 51% attack, where someone gains a majority of the hashpower on the network, they can change past blocks and if they are able to make a chain with more blocks on it (more proof of work), the network will accept the new chain as the source of truth (longest chain always wins, even if it is different than a previous chain).\n\nSo, the more blocks have been mined since the transaction occurred (aka number of confirmations), the more secure it will be from being reversed (or removed) in a reorganization or 51% attack.","213":"You have two options here\n\n\nHTTP triggered function and pass parameters using POST request\nQueue triggered function and pass parameters using Azure Storage Queue\n\n\nIn first case

However the description in the question is oriented in a way to talk about Byzantine Fault Tolerance.\n\nBroadly we can classify Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Crash Fault Tolerance. Byzantine behavior is the unexpected scenario arising because of the node, unpredictable result from the node, it could be intentional (malicious act from a node) or unintentional (machine's memory corruption\/hardware issues). Crash fault tolerance is the high availability of the system, though there can be random node failures in the network.\n\nThere's a general misconception that a Blockchain system should always be Byzantine Fault Tolerant. There can be multiple use cases for the Blockchain system. Choosing what to achieve through Blockchain is thus use case specific.\n\nFor example, in most public networks where there's incentive involved for creating a block in the network and there's no established trust or no means of establishing trust among the participants. A consensus algorithm which provides the Byzantine Fault Tolerance may be opt over there.\n\nAnother use case for the Blockchain is its immutability property, i.e. when a data\/state is added to the Blockchain it becomes highly computationally difficult to modify it. In case of private Blockchain consortium, participants may optionally prove their identity to the other nodes upon request through some other means and immutability property could be of interest to them. It may not matter who wins the election or who creates a block. To give you an instance, in case of Hyperledger Sawtooth with Raft as a consensus engine, leader gets a chance to create a block always. Raft provides Crash Fault Tolerance in the network as long as majority (50%+1) of the nodes are alive.\n\nHyperledger Sawtooth PoET when run on SGX is Byzantine Fault Tolerant and gives all the nodes a fair random chance to construct the block. In case if PoET is run in Simulator mode then it only gives the latter capability. The protection for Byzantine behavior is coming from the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) like Intel SGX.\n\nNote: Blockchain systems are designed so that participants get chance to validate blocks created by the winning node. They add the block to their ledger only after validation. In case of consortium a node will be caught if tries to manipulate and because there can be other means of identifying who is the participant, Byzantine behavior can be caught.\n\nA Blockchain is a distributed design solution, by virtue of its design it provides at the least Crash Fault Tolerance for the system as a whole. Since the same copy of data is replicated across the nodes (at least more than one node), the data is not lost even if there's a failure of one or two nodes in the network. High availability is guaranteed.\n\nI hope these points helped you to move next in your exploration.","238":"You need to serialization it. Serialization is the process of taking a structured set of data and making it into one string, number or vector of bytes that can then be de-serialized later on back into that struct. One method would be to take the hash of the block and use it as the key in the db then crate a new struct which does not contain the hash. Then write a function that takes a Block struct and a path and constructs a BlockNoHash struct and saves it. Then another function to read a block from a hash and spit out a Block Struct. Very basically you could split each field with a charector which will never occur in the data (eg ` or |), though this means if one piece of the data is corrupted then you cant get any of the other data","239":"Answer for this question could bloat, I will cover most part of it here for the benefit of folks who have this question, especially this will help when they want to deploy the network through Kubernetes.

If the transaction fee is lower than that,\nit is not relayed.","246":"Is this because the block is reaching its limit or because the bigger the block the more burden is put on the network.\n\n\nIt is because all full nodes have to download, verify, and relay the block. \n\nIt is trivial to create a valid block that has a lot of zero output transactions in order to increase the size of that block in bytes. If a block is considered valid, a full node will broadcast that block. This makes it difficult\/impossible for nodes without enough bandwidth and storage to continue processing the blockchain.\n\nAlso, the time to verify the block hash (two rounds of SHA256) increases, I believe linearly, with the input size. But, network latency will be of more concern and, of course, you can't verify a block unless you download it first.","247":"Disclaimer: Don't create brain wallets:  especially low entropy human generated ones.\n\nYou can generate any 32-byte value (technically valid private keys on secp256k1 curve must be between 0x1 to 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140) see Bitcoin Wiki\n\nOne way to do this is to hash the string you want to generate the key from:\n\nconst EC = require('elliptic').ec;\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\n\nconst ec = new EC('secp256k1');\nlet secret = crypto.createHash('sha256').update('password').digest('hex');\nlet keyPair = ec.keyFromSecret(secret);","248":null,"249":null,"250":"I searched the maven repository(https:\/\/mvnrepository.com\/artifact\/org.hyperledger.fabric-chaincode-java\/fabric-chaincode-shim\/1.4.2), found that this dependency is not in maven central repository.

Why are you looking into blockchain is there a specific application that blockchain is supposed to solve? It is usually not the silver bullet.\n\nAlso the definition of blockchain varies wildly based on context. For example, it may be a chain of blocks, but is there a consensus mechanism? Does it use proof of work, proof of stake, some other mechanism? Is it permissioned or permission-less? Is it public or private? The \"chain of blocks\" technology invented in Bitcoin was designed to provide distributed consensus of transaction data in a public, permission-less system. Any other system doesn't really need that technology.\n\n\n  1.) Very crucial: Where exactly is the DATA of the BLOCKCHAIN stored? Okay, so of course I know that every node in the chain has a copy of the ledger that is constantly updated. But this ledger, as far as my understanding goes, ONLY includes data about TRANSACTIONS, but not the actual data loaded into the blockchain? Or is this the same, since the BLOCKCHAIN can not store, say a \"video\" but only data about bitcoins transactions?\n\n\nBitcoin only stores transaction data (and meta data of each block such as block hash, timestamp, etc.), See Blocks. Some transactions use OP_RETURN scripts which allow storing arbitrary data and has been used to store photos, links, etc., but this has been a topic for debate as to whether it is good for the network to have all of this non-transaction-related data replicated across all full nodes.\n\n\n  2.) Either way, that means that the public blockchain is getting bigger in size by the minute. When every node stores the whole blockchain, it is only a matter of time until it all crashes since no one has enough room to store everything anymore, right?\n\n\nAssuming that data storage technology is stagnant and prices stay the same, yes. But that has obviously not been the case, so the hope is that it scales with the system. Also, you can run a light node, in which case the data is validated, but once it is validated it is discarded (generally speaking).\n\n\n  3.) Regarding smart contracts: It is my understanding that a smart contract is the only way to access the blockchain. If I wanted to set up my own blockchain, what I am doing is programming a smart contract that then accesses a server and loads data into the chain. Is this correct?\n\n\nBitcoin uses a scripting system for determining who can spend bitcoin (like locking it to a key pair, which must provide a valid signature. You can write scripts that could be considered smart contracts. Others like Ethereum have extended the concept for a turing-complete language. To send data (i.e. submit transactions) you must provide a valid transaction that has valid scripts or it will be rejected. \n\n\n  4.) How many \"public\" blockchains exist? Is it just this one? Or is there one public blockchain for every topic? \n\n\nThere are many applications (probably thousands) that say they are a public blockchain, and which use similar (or the exact same) technology as Bitcoin.","275":"The call stub.GetHistoryForKey(userNameIndexKey) will query the state database and not the ledger (channel).

After that smart contracts can provide a greater window of privacy by limiting users by their public private key addresses.  \n\nThe issue though is that once something is deployed on a blockchain you can never take it down. That means if that encryption method is ever broken our you passwords\/public-private keys are compromised, the data you stored up there is public information forever.\n\nIf you are using a traditional blockchain I would, based on personal experience, suggest you use the chain to manage your data, but store your data off the chain for now.

Bitcoin Core, the main implementation of the protocol uses TCP, but this is not necessarily required. It could use it's own protocol. All that matters is that any application that participates in the distributed application called Bitcoin agrees on the consensus rules (e.g. block validation rules, transaction validity, etc). Indeed other implementations of Bitcoin other than Bitcoin Core exist and are in use (e.g. libbitcoin).\n\nIn terms of OSI model, Bitcoin doesn't really need to affect any of the other layers, except to improve efficiency. Also, the OSI model only refers to the networking used in the blockchain, but while Bitcoin uses networking to enable the application, it is far more than a distributed network. It is the first application to use a reliable consensus protocol for agreeing on the state of a distributed application. \n\n\n\nNotes\n\nEven the physical layers have been affected, for example:\n\n\nBlockstream has enabled Bitcoin over satellite transmission to enable access to users around the world without a DSL\/Cable connection.\nBitcoin uses specialized hardware. Miners are specialized hardware, containing ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) that are optimized to convert energy (electricity) to SHA256 hashes per second (the hashing function used in mining). This hardware gets and sends data back and forth from the main Bitcoin application in order to perform it's mining function.\n\n\nRelated: https:\/\/bitcoin.stackexchange.com\/questions\/83410\/blockchain-and-iso-osi","284":"Well this requires a bit of cryptography understanding. \n\nIn private \/ public key pair cryptography, \"signing\" is basically the only case where you encrypt with the private key and you decrypt with the pub key.

Rather, as a probabilistic approach mitigates the chances for a successful double spend.\nWith blockchains (usually) one seeks for tolerating byzantine faults, which is only possible to a certain extent. In case of PoW you deal with a computational threshold adversary (51% attack), whereas with classical BFT protocols as a consensus layer alternative you deal with a threshold adversary model (3f+1). Alternatively, when using PoS you deal with a stake threshold adversary where you're again bound by resources.\nIt always depends on your use-case and what you are trying to solve with your system. Therefore, there is no one-to-rule-them-all solution and depending on your applications requirements certain consensus layer solutions might be more suitable than others.\n(Note: also other system properties as latency\/throughput etc. play an important role)\nSo to answer you question, if you generalise and consider byzantine faults, then yes, it is also a problem for other consensus protocols.

But it's a very large one. The address is derived from the user's public key. This is the same system that is used by SSL\/TLS (HTTPS) to secure websites.\n\nWhat you can do is let the user register with your system with his blockchain wallet address (for example Bitcoin wallet or Etheruem wallet). To authenticate the user just have the user sign a piece of data known to you (it could be as simple as the string \"Hello\"). Then using his wallet address you can verify that he is who he says he is because you've proven that he has the private key needed to sign the data. In some ways this is similar to how JWT (JSON Web Token) works but JWT does not use a blockchain.\nUsing a smart contract\n\nSome blockchain platforms such as Ethereum implement a feature known as \"Smart Contracts\". A smart contract is just a fancy name in the blockchain world for a Class that is stored in the blockchain and can interact with the blockchain. Some blockchain platforms such as Corda only allow you to store data in smart contracts and some limited validation logic. Others like Ethereum actually implement Turing-complete smart contracts that allow you to implement any logic.\n\nYou can implement your user data in smart contracts. Then the users will have to call the authentication method in the smart contract using his wallet address. All the regular security mechanisms protecting blockchain transactions are involved so the smart contract has access to the user's identity (address) and users cannot fake a transaction by using another user's address because he does not have other people's private keys. Using this you can implement authentication logic in smart contracts.","309":null,"310":"I installed truffle v5.0.24 and started working on the truffle console which solved all the issues.","311":"I don't get what you mean by blockchain being opened to internet.\n\nIf you are referring to the data structure of blocks forming a chain, it's just some files stored in peer component.

The lower the target value, the more work was done on the block, and the harder it is to change or \"hack\" the data in the block and still remain a valid block (because you must do the work again).\n\nThe merkle root is just a way to represent all of the transactions in the block in a single hash value, which is part of the data that is hashed to produce the block hash. If you change any of the transaction data, it will produce a different merkle root, and that will make the resulting block hash different too, and now the proof of work must be done again before the block would be considered valid.\n\nNow, with only one node, it does not matter. If you are able to change the data in a block and rehash that block with a new valid hash (one that is equal to or lower than the network target value), you have a new block, but the node will reject it because it already has that block. You must mine the next block also before anyone else because one of the consensus rules is that the longest valid chain always wins.\n\nHaving only one node running means that node can be changed by the person who is running it, possibly without anyone else knowing. This might remove certain rules that you thought we're being followed, which could reverse one of your transactions, so it is good to run your own node to make sure the rules are being followed.","327":null,"328":"Sometimes these things can just get locked up.

The free balance is the only balance that matters for most operations. When this balance falls below the existential deposit, most functionality of the account is removed. When both it and the reserved balance are deleted, then the account is said to be dead.\n\n\nThe free balance of an account is used whenever a transfer, withdraw, or reserve is initiated. Before these operations can complete successfully, ensure_can_withdraw is called with some WithdrawReason and checks that a withdrawal does not interfere with some vesting balance or locked balance.\n\nThis does not prevent other operations like slash from occurring, which does not care about any abstractions over free balance.\n\nVesting Balance\n\nAn account's vesting balance is an abstraction over it's free balance. More specifically, an account which has a vesting balance cannot spend from their free balance lower than that amount. Vesting balance does not care about the WithdrawReason.\n\namount_spendable = free_balance - vesting_balance\n\n\nSo even though an account may seem like it has a lot of liquid funds to spend when querying the free balance, an accounts vesting balance can prevent those funds from being withdrawn.\n\nVesting balance can only be set at the genesis of a Substrate chain, and decreases at a linear rate per block starting at some starting_block for a length of blocks, at which point vesting balance is zero. The vesting balance can be larger than the free balance in situations when the free balance is reduced by slashing. In these cases amount_spendable is saturated to zero.\n\nLocked Balance\n\nAn account's locked balance is another abstraction over it's free balance. In this case, it is a certain amount that is locked from withdrawing for a certain reason.\n\nThe different withdraw reasons are:\n\n\nTransaction Payment: In order to pay for (system) transaction costs.\nTransfer: In order to transfer ownership.\nReserve: In order to reserve some funds for a later return or repatriation.\nFee: In order to pay some other (higher-level) fees.\n\n\nSo if an account has a lock for 100 units with WithdrawReasons::Transfer, it cannot make a transfer which brings its free balance lower than 100 units. However, this account will be able to perform another operation like reserve taking its free balance below 100 units. A lock can have multiple reasons associated with it, in which case, those funds can only be spent for the other reasons.\n\nMultiple different locks can be placed on an account, but these locks overlay one another rather than stack. This means that if an account has 3 locks for 100 units, the account can spend it's funds for any reason down to 100 units, at which point the locks will start to come into play.\n\nLocked balance also overlays with vesting balance as these two are checked independently, but both checks must pass for ensure_can_withdraw to be successful.\n\nReserved Balance\n\nFrom the terminology section:\n\n\n  Reserved Balance: Reserved balance still belongs to the account holder, but is suspended. Reserved balance can still be slashed, but only after all the free balance has been slashed. If the reserved balance falls below the existential deposit then it and any related functionality will be deleted. When both it and the free balance are deleted, then the account is said to be dead.\n\n\nRelatively speaking, reserved balance is more simple than free balance because there are no abstractions over it. Funds which are reserved from a user are not meant to be directly touched by any other logic outside of the balances module. Instead, funds should first be unreserved and then modified in the free_balance.\n\nReserved Balance vs Locked Balance\n\nReserved balance and locked balance appear similar but are fundamentally different. Locked balance has an identity in terms of a lock identifier, what reasons funds are locked for, and how long they are locked for. A reserved balance has none of these traits, and are untouchable without explicit action from the runtime to unreserve those funds.\n\nFurthermore, there could be implications about having a free balance to versus not having one. For example, if you set a lock on the full free balance of an account, it will still have a free balance, and OnFreeBalanceZero will not be called. However, if you reserve all the funds, the free balance will drop below the existential deposit and OnFreeBalanceZero will be triggered for modules who have implemented this feature.","330":"Sure you can achieve this in Fabric. Take a look at Fabric's Private Data Collection. It allows you to store a subset, or all of data in what we call a SideDB. The block is still committed to the chain, but no data defined in the Private Collection is stored on the chain. Instead it is stored in the Private Collection on the SideDB and only accessible to those designated in the Collections config.\n\nHere is the official page: https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-1.4\/private_data_tutorial.html","331":"\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008b Welcome to Stack Overflow\n\nIf you're using https:\/\/remix.ethereum.org you can see the \"Environment\" in the top right hand corner of the IDE. \n\nAccording to the docs:\n\n\n  There are 3 type of environments Remix can be plugged to: Javascript VM, Injected provider, or Web3 provider.

This means you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need any other software or Ethereum node to run it. This makes it very simple to deploy contract and interact with contracts limits your ability to manage account\n\nThe Web3 provider will make remix connect to a remote node. You will need to provide the URL address to the selected provider: geth, parity or any Ethereum client. You can use a tool like ganache-cli which simulates a blockchain locally on your computer as well. \n\nThe Injected Provider will make remix connect to an injected web3 provider. Metamask is an example of providers that inject web3, thus can be used with this option.\n\nSee docs for more information about environments. \n\nI'm going to guess you're using the JavaScriptVM environment which means, unfortunately, you won't have access to web3 command tools (which need Web3 Provider or Injection). Without web3 you can't move funds between accounts by constructing transactions.\n\nWhat you can do is download ganache-cli or your favourite web3 provider, and manipulate accounts from the terminal using web3 commands. \n\nFor example:\n\n   $ ganache-cli \n\nAvailable Accounts <ADDRESSES YOU CAN MOVE FUNDS BETWEEN>\n==================\n(0) 0x9f0bf61721a61e7f72abac48eed65e318668e71f (~100 ETH)\n(1) 0x74bc67c48eefc359d296023acd4ac9158575ab56 (~100 ETH)\n(2) 0xec548e4b5246795b81904bc67cedfe26b528b173 (~100 ETH)\n(3) 0x06fe6ca72d985252729a2ba2a40147d4905a56c4 (~100 ETH)\n(4) 0x262498200090fdaa7db8d430e681e39d6257d3ce (~100 ETH)\n(5) 0x9736aa7dc69bee01166352c3e51023ee5ab57a08 (~100 ETH)\n(6) 0x19ee475e3c64935546d9c4a67d01232c53d45c2b (~100 ETH)\n(7) 0xee4dec500f7b08dfe20646a8a6661a81204eb1cb (~100 ETH)\n(8) 0xf5b6a5ce718ad527eb877a0c8554e1d2382c9beb (~100 ETH)\n(9) 0x590e03591cc82e9308d1e8e8869c248e13356920 (~100 ETH)\n\n<Secret private keys not shown >\n\nHD Wallet\n==================\n<Mnemonics not shown >\n\nBase HD Path:  m\/44'\/60'\/0'\/0\/{account_index}\n\nGas Price\n==================\n20000000000\n\nGas Limit\n==================\n6721975\n\nListening on 127.0.0.1:8545","332":"Please Try this.

This is how the transaction fee is created.\n\nCheck out the first bitcoin transaction made by Satoshi Nakamoto to Hal Finney in Block 170. Satoshi sent 10BTC to Hal and 40 back to himself. Since it was so early, there was no need for a transaction fee because they were mining the blocks themselves.

I recommend you read his paper to get a better idea.\n\nSmart contracts have however only recently been implemented in distributed systems. The advent of blockchain offered a suitable framework that allowed for decentralized execution of virtualized program code. One of the first frameworks was the Ethereum blockchain framework, which executes Solidity smart contracts in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. By now, there are many other technical methods of executing smart contracts (examples: Hyperledger Fabric uses chaincode (language-agnostic), run in Docker containers; EOS uses Web Assembly). These smart contracts are used in many decentralized applications these days and are mostly used to run services in a decentralized fashion, without a trusted third party.\n\nThey are not equivalent to legal contracts so far in any country (as far as I know). There are efforts to make smart contracts legally binding in some US states. There are also several tech companies working on integrating technical smart contracts with legal contracts. See here for an article discussing the differences between real-world law and smart contracts and what it takes for the latter to impact the former.","342":"I assume you are setting up your orderers with a BFT consensus plugin such as BFT-SMART. BFT algorithms are only required if you want to tolerate malicious faults. If you're only concerned about crash faults, you can also use Kafka consensus, which tolerates up to 50% crashing nodes. \n\nSo if you're setting up a business network, each partner should be running one ordering node. The number of tolerated malicious partners depends on your total number of partners. So if you have 4 partners, one of them can be malicious without your network breaking down, if you have 7 partners, you tolerate two, etc.\n\nSo it's not really a conscious choice that you're making in how many replicas to run. The number of tolerated malicious nodes depends on the number of independent partners you have running ordering nodes.

Of course, if the transaction has already been mined (included in a block) it will fail validation. This is necessary because unless that one node has a lot of hashpower, it will be very difficult to mine since it would be the only one to know about the transaction. There would also be a lot of conflicts if the mempool wasn't shared.\n\nOn your second question:\n\nWhen you submit a transaction, the wallet software should deduct that from your available balance (assuming it was not rejected). In Bitcoin (and other related currencies), if the transaction is not confirmed (included in a block) within a certain timeframe (Bitcoin is 2 weeks), then it will be removed from the mempool, and the coins are free to spend again.

As such, operations in your app will boil down to the following:\n\n\nCreating accounts on the blockchain\nFunding accounts on the blockchain\nSending payments\n\n\nYou can clone a sample implementation here - or you can follow the steps below to get a basic understanding.\n\nInstallation\n\nCreate an empty Unity project, and install the Kin Unity Plugin and modify your gradle file as described here.\n\nNOTE: The SDK only runs on an Android\/iOS device or emulator. The SDK will not run in the unity editor or unity remote -so you will need to compile and run the code in an emulator or device.\n\nImplementation\n\nCreate an empty MonoBehaviour script - name it KinWrapper, and declare the Kin namespace:\n\n    using Kin;\n\n\nYou can also enable blockchain listeners by adding the following to your MonoBehaviour :\n\n    public class KinWrapper : MonoBehaviour, IPaymentListener, IBalanceListener\n\n\nInstantiating\n\nNext declare instances of the Kin Client and Kin Account\n\n    private KinClient kinClient;\n    private KinAccount kinAccount;\n\n\nThe client handles the native code depending on the platform you are using. (Android or iOS). The account is the main interface you will be using.\n\nCreating an account\n\nBefore using the account, you first have to instantiate it through the client.\n\n    kinClient = new KinClient(Kin.Environment.Test, \"appId\");\n    if (!kinClient.HasAccount()) \n    {\n        kinAccount = kinClient.AddAccount();\n    }else{\n        kinAccount = kinClient.GetAccount(0);\n    }\n\n\nThe code above first checks to see if a local account exists on the device. If it doesn't, it creates an account on the device and returns that as a reference.\n\nNOTE: A 'created account' is simply a public key and private key generated on the device. These local keys enable the device to communicate with the blockchain.\n\nYou can now get the public key (client's blockchain address) by calling:\n\n    kinAccount.GetPublicAddress();\n\n\nOnboarding\/ Funding an account\n\nBecause this key only exists locally, you need to 'on-board' it to the blockchain. In other words, a special function needs to be called, to fund and register it online. Before this step is done, the address is considered invalid on the blockchain, and cannot receive or make transactions. This is part of the stellar protocol to avoid spam and unnecessary account creation.\n\nYou can check if the account has been on-boarded and funded by calling the following function:\n\n    kinAccount.GetStatus(GetStatusCallback)\n    void GetStatusCallback(KinException ex, AccountStatus status)\n    {\n         if (status == AccountStatus.Created)\n         {\n\n         }\n          else\n         {\n\n         }\n    }\n\n\nTo on-board and fund an account on the test blockchain, you have 3 options:\n\nOption 1: You can do this manually by pasting the address on Kin's friend-bot service. This will on-board the account for you automatically.\n\nOption 2: You can call the friend-bot through your code as an http request\nhttps:\/\/friendbot-testnet.kininfrastructure.com\/?addr=address_here\n\n    public static IEnumerator FundAccount( string publicAddress, Action<bool> onComplete = null )\n    {\n        var url = \"http:\/\/friendbot-testnet.kininfrastructure.com\/?addr=\" + publicAddress;\n        var req = UnityWebRequest.Get( url );\n\n        yield return req.SendWebRequest();\n\n        if( req.isNetworkError || req.isHttpError )\n        {\n            Debug.Log( req.error );\n            if( onComplete != null )\n                onComplete( false );\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.Log( \"response code: \" + req.responseCode );\n            Debug.Log( req.downloadHandler.text );\n            if( onComplete != null )\n                onComplete( true );\n        }\n    }\n\n\nOption 3: You can use server side code to fund it yourself (which you must do in a production environment). Basically, your client will need to call your server and request to be on-boarded. Your server can then use Kin's python SDK or node SDK to perform the on-boarding.\n\nHere is a handy  python implementation or Node.js implementation  you can use for your server.\n\nCalling the implementation from Unity is as simple as follows:\n\n    public IEnumerator FundMe(decimal amount, Action<bool> fundCallback = null)\n    {\n        WWWForm form = new WWWForm();\n        form.AddField(\"address\", kinAccount.GetPublicAddress());\n        form.AddField(\"amount\", amount.ToString());\n        reqUrl = \"http:\/\/address.to.your.server\";\n        var req = UnityWebRequest.Post(reqUrl, form);\n        yield return req.SendWebRequest();\n\n        if (req.isNetworkError || req.isHttpError)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(req.error);\n            fundCallback(false);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            fundCallback(true);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nNOTE: Kin has two blockchains. Production and Test. The test blockchain merely has \"play currency\" that you can run tests on without incurring costs. The production blockchain has real world value Kin\n\nCalling Other Functions\n\nGetBalance()\n\n    account.GetBalance(GetBalanceCallback);\n    void GetBalanceCallback(KinException ex, decimal balance)\n    {\n        if (ex == null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log( \"Balance: \" + balance );\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError( \"Get Balance Failed. \" + ex );\n        }\n    }\n\n\nDeleteAccount()\n\n    kinClient.DeleteAccount(0);\n\n\nNOTE: GetBalance() needs a callback because it's communicating with the blockchain online. DeleteAccount() doesn't because it simply deletes the private and public keys on the client. Once deleted, these keys can not be recovered.\n\nHandling transactions\n\nTransactions have the following parameters:\n\n\nMemo: an optional string with extra information.\nAddress: the address of the recipient\nAmount: amount of Kin you are sending (excluding fees)\nFee: the fee you will pay for your transaction to be processed by the blockchain. The current fee is 100\/100000 KIN. This fee protects the blockchain from spam.\n\n\nNOTE: The fee is denominated in the smallest unit of Kin. (Quark). Just like the smallest unit of a dollar is a cent. So when calling a transaction, set the fee to 100 (quarks) - which is 100\/100000 KIN. Setting the fee tells the blockchain you are explicitly agreeing to pay the transaction fee. If you set the fee too low, your transaction will be rejected.\n\nYou can view all transactions on Kin's blockchain at: https:\/\/laboratory.kin.org\/index.html#explorer?resource=payments\n\nTo send a payment, first build the transaction locally :\n\n    kinAccount.BuildTransaction(address, amount, fee, memo, BuildTransactionCallBack);\n\n\nBuilding a transaction performs several operations on the client to authorise it and sign it. After the transaction is built, use the following callback to send it to Kin's blockchain.\n\n    void BuildTransactionCallBack(KinException ex, Transaction transaction)\n    {\n        if (ex == null)\n        {\n            kinAccount.SendTransaction(transaction, SendTransactionCallback);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Build Transaction Failed. \" + ex);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nOnce you have sent the transaction to Kin's blockchain, you can listen for the response, to make sure it went through correctly. A transaction typically takes less than 10 seconds to complete.\n\n    void SendTransactionCallback(KinException ex, String transactionId)\n    {\n        if (ex == null)\n        {\n            \/\/Success\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Send Transaction Failed. \" + ex);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nNOTE: You should use co-routines for functions that need to wait. This will prevent your code from hanging while waiting for responses, and will create a better user experience.\n\nSending transactions with zero fees\n\nYou can send transactions with zero fees by being whitelisted by the Kin Foundation. To get whitelisted, simply register with the Kin Developer Program. Once approved, you can perform an extra step to let your client send transactions with zero fees.\n\nTo send a zero-fee transaction after building the transaction:\n\n\nThe client will need to contact your whitelisted server.\nYour server will approve\/ sign the transaction and send it back to the client.\nThe client will then send this approved transaction to Kin's blockchain, and it will be processed for free.\n\n\nWe have already built the transaction, now we whitelist it\n\n    void BuildTransactionCallBack(KinException ex, Transaction transaction)\n    {\n        if (ex == null)\n        {\n            StartCoroutine(WhitelistTransaction(transaction, WhitelistTransactionCallback))\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Build Transaction Failed. \" + ex);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nWe are calling our whitelisted server to authorise the transaction\n\n    IEnumerator WhitelistTransaction(Transaction transaction, Action<string, string> onComplete)\n    {\n        var postDataObj = new WhitelistPostData(transaction);\n        var postData = JsonUtility.ToJson(postDataObj);\n        var rawPostData = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(postData);\n\n        \/\/ UnityWebRequest does not work correclty when posting a JSON string so we use a byte[] and a hacky workaround\n        var req = UnityWebRequest.Post(baseURL + whitelistURL, \"POST\");\n        req.SetRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application\/json\");\n        req.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(rawPostData);\n\n        yield return req.SendWebRequest();\n\n        if (req.isNetworkError || req.isHttpError)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(req.error);\n            onComplete(null, null);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            onComplete(req.downloadHandler.text, transaction.Id);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nOur server has approved the transaction and sent back a signed string.

You can also use the node.js SDK.\n\nListening to events on the blockchain\n\nYou can add listeners to prevent your client from over-querying the blockchain. Simply add the following code\n\n    kinAccount.AddPaymentListener(this);\n    kinAccount.AddBalanceListener(this);\n\n   public void OnEvent(PaymentInfo data)\n   {\n         \/\/Listening for incoming and outgoing payments\n   }\n\n    public void OnEvent(decimal balance)\n    {\n        \/\/Listening for changes in client's balance\n    }\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\nYou can find this code implemented on: https:\/\/github.com\/hitwill\/kin-sdk-unity-tutorial under the MIT license.\n\nDeveloper Playbook\n\nYou can also check this Developer Playbook - for some higher level concepts of creating with Kin.\n\nBest practices\n\nUX\n\n(placeholder)\n\nServer side security\n\nHere is a great writeup on server side security.\n\nClient side security\n\n(placeholder)\n\nReducing calls to the blockchain\n\n(placeholder)","379":"For the latest in Substrate master\n\nSubstrate has removed As in favor of From\/Into.

Rather than strongly defining these types, using traits allows us to ensure that the types have certain properties, but are not limited in what the type can be. These generic type definitions live in trait Trait, which must be defined in each module.\n\nHere is an example of the custom types defined in the system module, which is used in nearly all other modules:\n\npub trait Trait: 'static + Eq + Clone {\n    \/\/\/ The aggregated `Origin` type used by dispatchable calls.\n    type Origin: ...\n\n    \/\/\/ Account index (aka nonce) type. This stores the number of previous transactions associated with a sender\n    \/\/\/ account.\n    type Index: ...\n\n    \/\/\/ The block number type used by the runtime.\n    type BlockNumber: ...\n\n    \/\/\/ The output of the `Hashing` function.\n    type Hash: ...\n\n    \/\/\/ The hashing system (algorithm) being used in the runtime (e.g. Blake2).\n    type Hashing: Hash<Output = Self::Hash>;\n\n    \/\/\/ Collection of (light-client-relevant) logs for a block to be included verbatim in the block header.\n    type Digest: ...\n\n    \/\/\/ The user account identifier type for the runtime.\n    type AccountId: ...\n\n    \/\/\/ Converting trait to take a source type and convert to `AccountId`.\n    \/\/\/\n    \/\/\/ Used to define the type and conversion mechanism for referencing accounts in transactions. It's perfectly\n    \/\/\/ reasonable for this to be an identity conversion (with the source type being `AccountId`), but other modules\n    \/\/\/ (e.g. Indices module) may provide more functional\/efficient alternatives.\n    type Lookup: StaticLookup<Target = Self::AccountId>;\n\n    \/\/\/ The block header.\n    type Header: ...\n\n    \/\/\/ The aggregated event type of the runtime.\n    type Event: Parameter + Member + From<Event>;\n\n    \/\/\/ A piece of information that can be part of the digest (as a digest item).\n    type Log: From<Log<Self>> + Into<DigestItemOf<Self>>;\n}\n\n\nIn your custom module, you will define something like:\n\n\/\/\/ The module's configuration trait.\npub trait Trait: system::Trait {\n    \/\/\/ The overarching event type.\n    type Event: From<Event<Self>> + Into<<Self as system::Trait>::Event>;\n}\n\n\nNote here that we have defined our own Event type, which our module can now use, but also we have inherited the traits from the system module (system::Trait), so we can also use all those types too!\n\nUsing Generic Types\n\nNow that we have defined some custom types in our runtime module, we can start to use them throughout our module logic.\n\nYou will always see a line like the second line in this code snippet:\n\ndecl_storage! {\n    trait Store for Module<T: Trait> as Sudo {\n        \/\/\/ The `AccountId` of the sudo key.\n        Key get(key) config(): T::AccountId;\n    }\n}\n\n\nSome of this line is macro magic, but importantly you see we define Module<T: Trait>. This means we have assigned our module's trait Trait as the generic parameter for Module under the alias of T.\n\nThus, we can then use T to reference these special types like we did above:\n\nT::AccountId\n\n\nGoing full circle, we can access this type because we have inherited it from the system::Trait definition!\n\nDeposit Event Macro Generation\n\nTo finally answer your question, the decl_module! function generates the function body of the deposit_event to save you from writing the same code over and over.\n\nWe detect the pre-defined function name deposit_event, and check for = default;, and then replace that with a working deposit_event function.\n\nHowever, when generating this function, the macro does not know if it should use a function where the input event is generic, or the input event does not use generics. Thus, you need to \"give it a hint\" by saying deposit_event<T>() or just deposit_event().\n\nIt will then produce the right version of the function which will work with the types in your module. If your module events uses any generic types, like T::AccountId or T::Balance, you will also need to define the generic version of deposit_event.","384":"Your question is too broad. \n\nYou could have find the answer very easily by checking the shim documentation (the following ling is for nodejs shim.

The choice of our new type name is important since it will trick the Polkadot UI to treat this value simply as a u8 for any input\/output fields it generates. If you try to use a custom type like type Byte = [u8; 1], the UI will ask you to import the definition of that custom type. If you try to use [u8; 1] directly, the Polkadot UI will not know how to render the input\/output of that value.\n\nFurthermore, as of the time of writing this post, the decl_event! macro has an issue depositing a [u8; 1] directly due to pattern matching.\n\nNote that you will need to treat this type like an array when you use it. add_to_byte() shows an example of that. So ultimately, you need to extract the first item of the array to extract the byte, and you need to wrap your byte in an array to set a U8:\n\nlet my_byte = Self::my_byte()[0];\n...\n<MyByte<T>>::put([my_new_byte]);\n\n\nOther solutions may involve using other types which are natively supported like Vec<u8> or u16, and doing the appropriate checks on your runtime that this is treated like a single u8, but the UI will not know better.\n\n\n\nSubstrate Smart Contracts\n\nI have not found a great solution for ink! yet, but you should be able to use [u8; 1] directly in all of your code. Again, you will need to treat it like an array for getters and setters. But when generating the ABI you will need to manually change the instances of [u8; 1] to u8 to trick the UI to do what you want.","386":"I have exactly the same issue.

As you can see in your screenshot, your browser storage has saved Alice as an ed25519 account from your past usage of the UI.\n\nTo repair this, you need to delete the version of Alice you have in your UI, and add a new Alice using the seed \/\/Alice. By default, the new UI which supports sr25519 should automatically use that cryptography to generate new accounts.\n\nOtherwise, if you want to generate new ed25519 accounts using this UI, you can do so by prefixing your seed like this: ed25519:\/\/Alice.","389":"Hyperledger Fabric is based on key-value stores (LevelDB and CouchDB), so you don't really gain any benefit from normalizing data.

So yes, in theory you can scale, just spin up another peer, create the API, etc, all this can be done automatically, via scripts. Your main issues is knowing when there is too much traffic and when to start spinning up new ones. Also, you might spin up a new one, but how is your app supposed to know a new endpoint is available? \n\nI suppose you could build a facade system and when your scripts spin a new peer and expose a new API, at that point this could be reported to the app so it maintains a list of available APIs, it just sounds like a lot of work for virtually no gain.\n\nI have to wonder, why didn't you simply build a normal API, put it in a cloud, let it scale automatically with built-in tools, job done?\n\nAll this aside, if it's too late to change now, maybe you can do it in a different way. Your app could be talking to a queuing system and this is the one pushing the votes to a peer, when available. If it's not available, it can wait, it just means the votes will come in a bit later. So your app doesn't directly talk to the REST APIs, sends messages with votes to a queue, then you have another app which monitors this queue and uses the REST APIs, if they are up. You could even implement a system, where you decide how many votes you send in 1 go, over a period of time or whatever.

The relation between SCs and blocks is the same as the relation between the code of any application and the way your database software works... mostly no relation.\n\nThis is: blocks are how blockchain stores data. A SC are the rules that say how your data changes.\n\n\n  Is each block a 'version' of all of the properties which belong to a contract?\n\n\nNope. A block is a group of transactions. A transaction is an operation that changes your data.\n\n\n  There is an instance of a smart contract per block\n\n\nNope. Only when you deploy a smart contract to the network, you send a complete copy of the bytecode of the compiled SC inside a special transaction that goes into a block.

I've turned to Indy community and got to know that this part of the walkthrough tutorial is a bit outdated. Quoting Stephen Curran from Hyperledger Indy's RocketChat channel:\n\n\n  The pairwise DID concept had not been fleshed out enough and so all\n  DIDs in code were being written to the ledger.\n\n\nTo elaborate on public and pairwise DIDs bit more:\n\nNYM Transaction write a DID with associated Verkey (a public part of keypair). You have to however distinguish between public DID and pairwise DID. \n\n\nPublic DID - is identifier which you publish out there for everyone to know. If you are an institution, you want to have such identifier. People\/their devices can then use it to establish the initial secure connection with the institution.\nPairwise DID - is DID which identifies secure channel you've establish with someone. For example, if once you've contacted an institution using their public DID, they would generate pairwise DID (a key pair and DID identifier) for talking with you. You would also generate pairwise DID to identify connection to them (and to encrypt the communication using the keys associated with the pairwise DID)\n\n\n Question 2\n\n\nI think you are referring to the step 10:\n\n\n\n  Faber asks the ledger for the Verification key of the Steward's DID\n  by calling did.key_for_did.\n\n\nSo here Faber reads Steward's DID and its associated verkey (a public key) from the ledger. Faber then uses this key to encrypt the message - the message won't be decryptable by anyone but the Steward, holder of the private part for that verkey.\n\nQuestion 3\n\nHere's how connections are typically established:\n\nSome secure channel is assumed to be established by which one party receive connection invite from the other. You could get for example invite via HTTPS, or simply by employee of a bank presenting you a QR code containing the invite for connection from a Bank. \nWhen generating the connection invite message, the inviting party generates pairwise DID with verkey. This is included in the invite message, so assuming you got this invite secured delivered by any means, it's safe to say you can send encrypted messages to the inviting party.\nAt this point, you would generate your pairwise DID and Verkey for this connection and send this data to the inviter. At this point, you have established secure connection because you both securely exchanged each other's pairwise DIDs\/Verkeys for the session.","483":"Just use stub.getCreator() and explore the returned object.\n\nlet sender = await stub.getCreator();\nlet senderOrg = sender.mspid;\nif(senderOrg=='SpecialOrg'){\n    \/\/ do your business\n} else {\n    \/\/ whatever\n}\n\n\nMore information directly in interfaces.go: https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/blob\/release-1.4\/core\/chaincode\/shim\/interfaces.go","484":"If the ABCI app logic processing the Commit message sends a broadcast_tx_sync or broadcast_tx_commit and waits for the response before proceeding, it will deadlock. \n\nExecuting those broadcast_tx calls involves acquiring a lock that is held during the Commit call, so it's not possible.\n\nIf you make the call to the broadcast_tx endpoints concurrently, that's no problem, it just can't be part of the sequential logic of the Commit message","485":"this line {-# STDLIB_VERSION 2 #-} stands for the standard library version(the latest version is STDLIB_VERSION 3) which is important to include ride4dapps standard functionality(built-in functions) and the Postfix notation.\n\nthis line {-# CONTENT_TYPE EXPRESSION #-} represents the type of a contract which is \n\n\nEXPRESSION for smart accounts and smart assets.\nDAPP for ride4dApps.\n\n\nThe last line {-# SCRIPT_TYPE ACCOUNT #-} represents the script type, which is:\n\n\nASSET for smart assets script.\nACCOUNT for smart accounts and ride4dApps scripts.","486":"If you use Waves transactions api, the request should be signed already and you can post it to \/transactions\/broadcast.

All these steps can be achieved directly via REST API endpoints if the REST API has the privileges to do so.

The sponsorship is set by giving the rate at which fee in an asset is converted to WAVES.\n\n\nSmart Contracts Transactions\n\n\nSet Script Transaction: you can use it to set so up an smart account so this transaction sets the script which verifies all outgoing transactions.\nSet Asset Script Transaction: you can use it to change a smart asset\u00e2\u0080\u0099s script and only the issuer of that asset  can change the asset's script.\nInvoke Script Transaction: you can use it to invoke functions in your smart contract.\n\n\nTransaction versions\n\nThere are two versions of transactions (V1,V2), in the new version the transactions are signed by proofs instead of using a signature. So basically signature is replaced with proofs. Proofs are an alternative way to authorize the transaction that is more flexible than signatures and enables smart contracts such as multisig and atomic swap. Each proof is a Base58 encoded byte string and can be a signature, a secret, or anything else \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the semantics of a proof is dictated by the smart contract that interprets it.

The node checks for the solution and accepts the block if the solution is correct. \n\nTransaction's reward is the transaction fees which are collected by all the transactions fees from a given block. So, if a miner mines a block with 10 transactions and each transaction of 0.5eth fees then the total fees collected will be 5eth. However, in reality, the transaction fees are calculated by the amount of Gas consumed multiplied by the gas price paid by the sender.\n\nHope this helps.","514":"As per my understanding, I run your code.

If a single company owns all nodes, you might as well use a single server, there's not much of a difference (unless you want independence of multiple locations within the organization). You should only use BigchainDB - or blockchain in general for that matter - if you're dealing with multiple semi-trusted participants who are trying to write to a shared database while ensuring there transparency, auditability and integrity.\n\nSo in your use case (a single organization storing all data to share with others): no, there is no clear advantage to using BigchainDB over a custom MongoDB implementation.\n\nEdit: I just saw that this question was answered by Troy McConaghy (creator of BigchainDB) on Medium. Since his answers differs slightly, I'll include it here:\n\n\n\n\nDecentralization isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an all-or-nothing property, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a continuum. Even if a single company runs all the nodes, they can have each one operated by a different employee, in a different business unit, in a different country, for example.\nThere are two general approaches to adding immutability to MongoDB using code. One is to try and do it in the application layer. The problem with that is that the MongoDB database is one logical database, so anyone who manages to gain admin-like privileges on one node can change or delete records across the entire database: there is a single point of failure, making its \u00e2\u0080\u009cdecentralization\u00e2\u0080\u009d dubious. (In BigchainDB, each node has an independent MongoDB database, so corrupting one doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect the others.) The other way would be to fork MongoDB to make it so it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change or delete existing records. Go ahead, it will take hundreds of coder hours to do that and in the end all you have is something similar to Datomic or HBase. Why not just use one of those instead? Of course, those still have the central admin problem, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably want to fork\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nYes, almost any database can be used to track and manage asset transfers. You would have to add that thing where only the true owner of an asset can make the transfer happen (by providing a valid cryptographic signature), but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s totally doable in the application-level code (or maybe in the database\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal scripting language). It all takes time and BigchainDB has that out of the box.","528":"Try to restart the network, delete and reimport all card.","529":"How to protect from 51% Attack?\n\n\nThe nature of the system means that this attack cannot be prevented. Think of it this way, if you have a perfectly decentralized system in which the participants have control over the network (not some centralized authority), then the users get to vote on changes. The way to vote in blockchain is with your mining hashpower. If a majority (>50%) of the network votes on a change, then the change goes into effect (theoretically). So, how could you prevent this unless you centralize the network?\n\nNow, in actuality, an attacker would likely need much more than 51% because not only do they have to outpace the network, they have to do so with every block after the one they want to modify, because what if a new block is mined by someone else while they are trying to outpace the network? They would need much more hashpower to have a good chance of successfully pulling it off.\n\nPrevention\n\nThe real answer is you can't really prevent it, since it is a decentralized network, but if you are designing a new blockchain, the answer is to make it as decentralized as possible. Here are some considerations:\n\n\nCommoditization of the mining hardware (commoditizing ASICs). Note this goes against some conventional thinking, that hashing algorithms should be ASIC resistant, but there is a good article that explains why that is a bad idea: ASICs and Decentralization FAQs Users who have to pay a lot, or find it difficult to get hashpower will likely not mine and it will be left to a few large players with the resources to do so. This results in more centralization of mining. \nAvoid forking an existing coin with much larger hashpower. Users of the original coin now own coins on your new chain and are incentivized to attack it if they have a much larger portion of hashpower they can switch over to the new coin. If you do fork an existing coin, consider changing the hashing algorithm so miners of the original coin would have to invest more capital in order to attack.","530":"There are 2 participating variables here\n\n\ntimestamp at which the record is created.\nthe data. \n\n\nSolution premise,\n\n\nTampering proof.\nthe data can be changed in the same GMT calendar day without violating tamper-proof guarantee.

In a proof of work blockchain, nodes on the network generally increment the nonce value until they find one with the desired output. The constraint of the output hash is determined by the current chain difficulty. The chain difficulty essentially is used to define an acceptable output hash, and any hash that passes the constraint is accepted and the block can then be published with the nonce as part of the metadata. In Bitcoin the difficulty changes every 2016 blocks and is adjusted up (harder) or down (easier) depending on the time it has taken to publish the last 2016 blocks, versus the ideal time for 2016 blocks (which is 2016 * 10 mins, or approximately 2 weeks) See this for more info on difficulty and how it is used in bitcoin.","620":null,"621":"What is the difference and what benefits it is giving in chaincode endorsement validation?\n\n\nIn your organization you will have roles, and every role will have their privileges.

But, blockchain by itself just means a chain of blocks, which is just a data structure. Without a consensus mechanism, it is not really that interesting or useful. The proof of work consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin requires a minimum amount of computation to be done on the block before it is considered according to network rules. This provides distributed consensus because in order for a change to be made to a past block in the blockchain, more work must be done that was previously done in order to change it, so it would require a majority of computation (see 51% Attacks). This attack is deterred by providing an economic incentive (in the form of tokens) for miners, who should find it more profitable to mine than to attack the network, and damage the security and value of their coins.\n\nI suggest you read the Bitcoin Whitepaper, and learn about the problem blockchain was designed to solve. For e-voting, more consideration must be made beyond the immutability and consensus mechanism including the incentive to attack the network. What incentives would participants have to support vs attack the ledger of votes, and what would it take to do that.

However, the bootstrapping process of the Azure Ethereum Proof-of-Authority template does not prealocate any Ether to any pre-allocated accounts in the Chain Specification (genesis) file. Therefore, there is no Ether to begin with. \n\nThe primary reasoning behind this is that Ether serves no purpose in a private Ethereum network unless Proof-of-Work consensus is being used. Proof-of-Work in Ethereum natively requires gas to send transactions and thus the Ether equivalent of gas is necessary to transact on the network. With Proof-of-Authority consensus enabled, there are no gas costs, and thus Ether is not required. \n\n\n  If it is possible would it be a customized version of the Ether only usable in my network and not affected by the value of the currency?\n\n\nThe Ether used on this network would belong solely to this network and has no use on any other Ethereum-based blockchain network.\n\n\n  Can I programmatically create Etherum wallets for users that sign up in my system and load Ether coins into their wallets?\n\n\nAgain, technically, yes. However, this is where I disagree with the above answer. Accounts should not be created directly as part of the network aside from the initial bootstrapped Validator nodes. Accounts should be created programmatically (using a library akin to ethereumjs-wallet) or managed by an external wallet such as MetaMask. In fact, the Azure Ethereum PoA documentation outlines that it is insecure to unlock the personal API for account creation and that accounts should be pre-signing transactions outside of the network.\n\nAlthough, again, there is no initial supply of Ether on the network and this would require you re-writing the Chain Specification and re-bootstrapping the network which is not the intention behind the Azure PoA template.","650":"You're likely using the personal API and unlocking your accounts.

Here's a simple way to test in Remix:\n\npragma solidity 0.5.2;\n\ncontract Test {\n    uint256[] foo;\n    uint256[] bar;\n\n    constructor() public {\n       for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; i++) { \n           foo.push(i);\n       }\n       for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n           bar.push(i);\n       }\n    }\n\n    function deleteFoo() external {\n        foo.length =  0;\n    }\n\n    function deleteBar() external {\n        bar.length = 0;\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn my testing, using the JavaScript VM, deleteFoo consumes 26,070 gas, and deleteBar consumes 266,267 gas.","653":"Fabric allows for the use of a certificate authority which can provide x.509 certificates to new nodes joining the network.

Pleas reference this article for a better understanding of the difference between the two. Since storage is dynamic, you cannot directly add an element to an index as that index may not exist in storage. If you wish to add an element to a dynamic storage array, you should use push() like so:\n\nfunction addCandidate(string memory name) public {\n    Candidate memory newCandidate = Candidate(candidateCount, name, 0);\n    candidates.push(newCandidate);\n}\n\n\nA secondary option would be to use a mapping as mappings are more favorable than arrays within Solidity due to less complexity and cost.

Understand, this cost can be largely effected by how well structured your Solidity smart contract code is written. Note, this is of course also only an estimate as users could always expend more Ether to have their transaction confirmed quicker or the state of the data within the smart contract could change over time requiring higher gas costs (i.e. iterating a growing array). For more information on gas costs within the Ethereum mainnet, you can take a look at ETH Gas Station.\n\nAs a side note, since I do not know your particular use case for blockchain technology, it could be helpful to weigh out whether or not it makes sense to utilize the Ethereum mainnet or to spin up your own private Ethereum blockchain. With the latter you would completely avoid having to spend any Ether to interact with blockchain network, but you would likely have additional overhead.","677":"There is no explicit web3.js method for finding the contract creator address.

for your answer and your attention. Your comments are very enlightening. What seems to be quite dificult for me is to understand the mechanism behind PoW.

Thanks a lot especially for pointing out the two different types of certificates in fabric.  With the clarification of two different types of certificates, I'm able to understand that in the case of a TLS certificate, only the inter-component connection authentication might be affected and it's easy to handle by just replacing it with a new one.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0WayChan\n                \n                Dec 31, 2019 at 7:11\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                In the case of an enrollment certificate, about the validity of signatures made before the signing certificate expired or revoked, I agree that its obvious that the signatures stay valid even after the expiration or revocation of its signing ceritifcate.  When I posted the question, I was looking for a technically way to validate whether a signature was signed during the validity of its signing certificate. Then I found the method called Time Stamping Signatures, which yields a trusted Time Stamp Authority to sign our data with a trusted timestamp.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0WayChan\n                \n                Dec 31, 2019 at 7:54\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Time stamping the signatures seems to be a good way, but I'm not sure what's the fabric way to validate such signatures.

You can notice that all the subsequent transactions have \"from: V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f\", so the V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f is author of these subsequent transactons. You can also note thaat in the transaction you are pointing out the  V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f  DID was assigned ROLE 0 which is Trustee. If I remember right, the seed generating DID V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f is 000000000000000000000000Trustee1\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Patrik Stas\n                \n                Jan 7, 2020 at 14:32\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Thank you for the answer! Yes you are right, but who's identity is that? For example, from what I study I assume that the DID Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y is the Steward for Node1, and this leads to another question. Does every node has a Steward\/Observer Role?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Polem\n                \n                Jan 7, 2020 at 14:58\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    2\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Well, these are genesis transactions for indy pool in docker. It's supposed to be used just for development. So it's a sort of \"admin\" DID with high-privileged role. Afaik if you want to run node participating in the consensus, you need to own DID with Steward role. Some more info here ldapwiki.com\/wiki\/Indy%20Steward .

I mean, when I use the release version of the nodeos binary, I can deploy the eosio.system contract. But after reset, deploy the eosio.system contract with the debug version of the nodeos binary, which will report the above error.  I guess that because of the debug mode, the time to run this transaction is greater than the default single transaction runtime of eos.

One thing you didn't touch on is performance. My generic answer here is that \"it depends on your use case\". But, \"less is more\" and when it comes to centralized vs decentralized, it should be intuitively obvious that the centralized system is going to have far less work to do and thus should have better performance.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Marc\n                \n                Nov 9, 2019 at 4:04\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","102":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","103":"added more comments to question\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0asing177\n                \n                Nov 9, 2019 at 10:37\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                I added additional details in my answer\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Arun\n                \n                Nov 9, 2019 at 17:04\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","104":null,"105":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","106":"Ok, I get txhex (tx one, name changed) from here,                                               const tx = new bitcore.Transaction()         .from(inputs)         .to(outputs) \/\/ so what should I do, provided inputs and outputs are correct, because if I sign it here then its working\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Deepak Garg\n                \n                Nov 7, 2019 at 9:15\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                How do you convert tx into txhex?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0StillFantasy\n                \n                Nov 7, 2019 at 9:22\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                After getting hex I applied .toString() and stored that value into txhex.

The dockerized Tendermint node0 will need a configuration as well.

When you want to store data in a blockchain you create a transaction, some transactions together makes a block, this block needs to be mined by the miners worldwide to be verified and authenticated, miners are paid in tokes for their effort. part of the payment comes from the owners of the transaction 2. You can think of blockchain as a public database. You can see all information stored in blockchain. etherscan.io here you can see all the data stored in the ethereum main-net.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Iftifar Taz\n                \n                Sep 17, 2019 at 16:46\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                So for the part of verifying and authenticating by miners, how can I develop this function?

In my project I do not want to have control over the wallets of the user. The user should be the only one who controls it. That's why I generate a high quality salt and store it in my DB. The user generates a strong password in his browser. After that the user can obtain the salt from the API combines it within his browser with the salt and this results in the private key. His password is never transferred over the network. If the database is hacked, the attacker does not get the private keys of the users.

By ensure, I mean that it is not possible for a developer to accidentally construct the runtime while having a different order.

In a practical scenario, lets say I have 3 Orgs - Org A, B and C as a part of a Channel. For few specific transactions, I want to have endorsements from Orgs A and B because these transactions are of high interest to A and B. But for few other transactions, I might want endorsements from Orgs A and C because these transactions are of high interest to A and C. Does this scenario make sense?

But, this would end up being the endorsement policy for that key for all the transactions related to that key. I will not be able to achieve different endorsement policy for each transaction type for a single key. 2) If I start setting endorsement policies differently for each key, say, I have 10000 keys, I would have to set endorsement policy for each one of them.

Also I tried to use metamask using Mnemonic of local test blockchain.  if i understood correctly, your suggestion is that web3.sendTransaction({to:receiver, from:sender, value:web3.toWei(\"0.5\", \"ether\")}) Is there any way to do this in Remix IDE\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0osman s\u00c3\u00b6nmezt\u00c3\u00bcrk\n                \n                Jun 7, 2019 at 7:47\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                have you tried address.send(amount) or address.transfer(amount) method? you have to convert ethers into wei first with uint256 amount = 0.5 * 1 ether then send to payable address\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Sumit kumar\n                \n                Jun 21, 2022 at 14:32\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","332":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","333":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","334":"i think solidity code is correct, just recode smart contract code and web3 and debug every your code.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Geraldine Adi Rachmattullah\n                \n                Jun 1, 2019 at 16:44\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","335":"1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                sr25519::Public::from_ss58check(\"5GukQt4gJW2XqzFwmm3RHa7x6sYuVcGhuhz72CN7oiBsgffx\").unwrap()    Above code should be replaced by below code in substrate v2.0.0-rc2:   AccountId::from_ss58check(\"5GukQt4gJW2XqzFwmm3RHa7x6sYuVcGhuhz72CN7oiBsgffx\").unwrap()\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0chen_767\n                \n                Jun 6, 2020 at 11:15\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                That yields: function or associated item not found in AccountId32\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0shredding\n                \n                Nov 9, 2022 at 16:58\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","336":"1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                This is kind of a bad example as he sent the change back to the same address; it's best practice to generate a new address for receiving the change.

(2) Sometimes, you would want to keep your smart contract code private, if you have some secret logic you don't want people to find out, or it can be that you don't trust someone else's code to run on your peers, even if it's inside a container.  (3) As for the last question - you can deploy Fabric in every way that you manage to deploy it.... it's like lego - you build what you want from it.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0yacovm\n                \n                Apr 28, 2019 at 20:44\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","406":"I already tried using a query as invocation but it does not work, can you be clear? can you write some code or references?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Julian Solarte\n                \n                May 3, 2019 at 22:19\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                What does your code look like for invoke?

(2) After you get the peer list, you can call client.queryChannels(peer) method for each peer in that list  Hope this can help you!\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Hnampk\n                \n                Apr 26, 2019 at 1:29\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","416":null,"417":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","418":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","419":null,"420":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","421":"where do i insert these function in hyperledger fabric scripts?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0codeme\n                \n                Apr 23, 2019 at 21:22\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","422":null,"423":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","424":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","425":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","426":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","427":null,"428":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","429":null,"430":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","431":"\"keys are generally one time use\" This is true for Bitcoin but not for Ethereum, where key reuse is the norm.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0user94559\n                \n                Apr 19, 2019 at 20:36\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Thanks for the info.

This means that either all state updates resulting from the chaincode execution are applied to the ledger - or none, in case of a failure (which you could trigger yourself in your chaincode if something goes wrong).\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Sigmatics\n                \n                Apr 19, 2019 at 12:37\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","444":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","445":"Thank you for your comment.

The idea here is that the entire collection of data -- from the beginning, with zero records up to the present state -- can be proven to be immutable.

Free materials are available at https:\/\/jbaczuk.github.io\/blockchain_fundamentals. Here is some info, if you have any specific questions about proof of work, please add it and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to answer for you.\n\nProof of Work\n\nProof of work is what a miner must provide with their block candidate in order for the network to consider that block valid. A proof of work is given as a 32 byte value which is calculated using the block data and a hash function, so it is called a block hash.\n\nFinding a valid block hash\n\nThis step is the process commonly referred to as mining. This is where the most work is done, and provides the basis for a secure network.\n\nBlock Hash\n\nThe block hash is created by taking the block header, and providing it as an input to the SHA256 hashing algorithm. The nonce is continually changed until a valid solution is found. Miners are, quite literally, optimized guessing machines hoping the next random nonce will result in a valid hash. The fastest, most power efficient hardware will be the most profitable. Power costs and air temperature in a given region will also affect mining profitability.\n\nHash Functions\n\nHash functions are one-way functions, meaning they can only be computed in one direction. You can easily hash an input, but you cannot calculate an input that will result in a specific output. In order to do so, you have to keep providing a new random input until the solution is found. In Bitcoin, this is also known as work, the number of guesses, on average, that a miner must make in order to calculate a valid hash.","1":"First of all, there are 2 types of certificates in Fabric:\n\n\nTLS certificates \nEnrollment certificates\n\n\nFor TLS certificates, when they expire - they cannot be used anymore but obviously active TLS connections aren't being terminated when it happens. \n\nFor enrollment certificates - when they expire they still keep on being useful regardless of their expiration. This is to prevent a fork when peers join the Blockchain late. So, in short - certificate expiration has no effect in enrollment certificates.\n\n\nShould renewal of a certificate require a new PKI key pair in best practice, or should a new certificate be created with the original key\n\n  \n  pair be created with its validity extended?\n\n\nIn most cases, Fabric treats 2 certificates with the same public key but different attributes as 2 completely different identities (unless you take into account de-duplication at transaction validation) so if you have a chance to renew a certificate of a node or a client - you might as well also use a fresh key. It is not required but it is possible. \n\n\n  What if it's the case when a private key got compromised, and I\n  have to revoke the original certificate and use a new one with a new\n  key pair. In this case, how should I validate signatures of\n  transactions that were already persisted in the ledger? I wonder if it\n  means that even if a certificate were revoked, it should be kept for\n  validating history signatures.\n\n\nFor TLS certificates, Fabric doesn't use CRLs so you can only rely on short expiration periods, or you can always just replace the entire certification chain and this would implicitly invalidate the leaf certificates of the old chain.\n\nFor Enrollment certificates you can issue a CRL config update to all channels and this would make it impossible to use the compromised key in future transactions, however signatures of transactions made in the past (in the blocks that precede the revocation of the certificate) would still be valid from obvious reasons.\n\nHowever, there is a code path that checks expiration of enrollment certificates: Whenever a request from a peer or a client is authenticated to access a resource (i.e a client wants to execute a chaincode, or a peer wants to pull blocks) - then the certificate expiration of enrollment certificates is also checked by the server (peer\/orderer).","2":"There are 2 errors in theconfigtx.yaml.  \n\n\nOrderer: Is a map type or object type, not an array or slice type.

Fabric SDKs also tend to toss in a conversion to a string definition. Your only option is to work with bytes or strings. You could use your own custom parsing or for more advanced use, you could use some type of serialization protocol (see comparison). However, both your application and chaincode needs to support it.\n\nWhen you need to send objects, I would recommend creating a chaincode function such as createShipment for your case, which accepts as many arguments as needed to construct the object. If the object itself contains an array of objects (FreightContainer) you could register this as an object itself (createFreightContainer) which contains an ID to the Shipment.","16":"In the PoW systems, block signing is not needed, because of block ID id generating by hashing root of Merkle Tree (Merkle Root) of payload transactions and nonce, until hash become less than target.\n\nIf do analogous approach in PoS system, them malicious minter can generate lot of attempts with different output hashes from a same kernel UTXO (transaction output, which mints coins) - just by modify nonce and\/or rearrange transaction in Merkle Tree, there is lot of combinations. And by this way, he can reduce PoS to PoW (lot of hashing attempts with same data).\n\nTo prevent such degradation, PoS cryptos (PPC, EMC, etc) limits number of attempts for some specific UTXO. And hash result (which compared to a target) depends only from kernel UTXO and from current time, and independent from nonce, block payload, and so. As result, PoS minter can make a single attempt for each matured UTXO only once per second.\n\nBut, with this approach, block content is not participate in the kernel hash, which compares to target.  \n\nAs result, if minter does not sign a block, malicious actor can do following attack: He can intercept from the network a freshly-minted block from a minter, modify payload transactions and Merkle Tree and block hash (for example, add double spend TX), and redistribute the modified block over the network. Such block will contains valid coinstake transaction (which spends kernel UTXO), and will be accepted by network nodes.\n\nTo prevent this \"modify freshly-minted block on the fly\", block is signed by address of kernel UTXO. By this signature, minter provides a proof: Block is created by same minter, who generates a coinstake TX.\n\nThus, with PoS, block generation is following:\n\n\nFind appropriate kernel UTXO \nGenerate coinstake transaction, which sends coins from kernel UTXO address to itself.  \nCreate a new block,contains this coinstake TX and payload TXes \nSign this block with coin address of kernel UTXO.\n\n\nPractically, enough to sign just a header, contains Merkle Root.","17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":"(As per the comments in your question.)\n\nRight now you're measuring the latency between India and us-west-2, not the latency of QLDB operations.

Both Fabcar and Commercial Paper have their different applications in their respective application folders.\nApplications can interact with our channel or say underlying fabric layer through a gateway. \n\n\n\n  The Hyperledger Fabric SDK provides a gateway abstraction so that\n  applications can focus on application logic while delegating network\n  interaction to the gateway. Gateways and wallets make it\n  straightforward to write Hyperledger Fabric applications. Find here in the docs\n\n\n\nOur applications require some identity to be able to use underlying fabric layer. This identity's authenticity is checked by gateway before allowing access to the network.\nFabric uses concept of keys and signed certificates to perform this authentication. \n\n\nDiving into a different concept here, fabric provides two kind of certification architectures (architecture might not be the correct word),\n\n\ncryptogen - generally used for developement or testing purposes to generate keys and certificates\nCertificate Authority - not a new concept, used by fabric to generate certificates. Any CA server requires to have admin to allow generating certificates.\nWhile bringing up the server itself, this bootstrap identity is created using fabric-ca-server start with a -b option with username:password parameter.  \n\n\nComing back to fabric, before starting any network (basic-network or first-network) fabric asks us to generate cryto-config.\n\n\nCommercial Paper uses certificates and keys generated by this previously generated crypto-config by cryptogen to generate identities for the application.\nFabcar uses CA to generate certificates and keys.

New user require both registration and enrollment (done using CA admin identity).\n\n\n\n  The private and public key are first generated locally and the public\n  key is then sent to the CA which returns an encoded certificate for\n  use by the application.

Find here in the docs\n\n\nSo it's not by design of fabric why Fabcar used CA and why Commercial-Paper used cryptogen, it's simply by choice.\n\nI'll end my answer, quoting exact statement from the fabric documentation.\n\n\n\n  When we created the network, an admin user literally called admin\n  was created as the registrar for the certificate authority (CA).\n  Our first step is to generate the private key, public key, and X.509\n  certificate for admin using the enroll.js program.

The extension can push data to the website, or the website can request data by doing message passing requests. Private keys are stored in the sandboxed local storage and requests are made from the website to the extension to sign messages. The extension returns the signed message to the website.\n\nWeb-based:\n\nBrowser-based crypto wallets such as Authereum, Portis, Torus, and Fortmatic, use sandboxed local storage as well via an iframe. Unlike cookies, local storage is strictly restricted by domain, meaning that if a website sets a value in local storage, then only that website can read the value; so alice.com cannot read bob.com's local storage. To sandbox local storage sensitive values, they are set under a controlled subdomain, for example x.wallet.com, since no other website will be able to read the local storage. This subdomain contains no UI is meant for iframed communication only. The web3 provider's of those wallets load a hidden iframe on the website, which is used to communicate to the subdomain containing the sandboxed storage; so for example Alice on dapp.com using Authereum, the Authereum sdk connects to x.authereum.org using an iframe and send postMessage requests to the iframe from the website to sign messages. This restricts the website from reading sensitive data such as private keys and only allow the website to send sign requests similarly to how wallet extensions work.\n\nNot all web-based wallets have sandboxed local storage so you should avoid using those since any website can read the stored sensitive data but the wallets mentioned here are safe in that regard.\n\nProtection against phishing attacks\n\nPhishing attacks occur when a user is tricked into thinking they are using a known website but instead are using a malicious website that resembles the legitimate website. Authereum, Portis, and Torus are username and password based login solutions so they open up the login auth window in a new popup or redirect. This allows the user to verify the domain of the website for legitimacy. Google auth does this pattern as well. Besides opening a new window on login for the user to verify, some web-based wallet providers also open a new window when signing messages and transactions to verify the request.\n\nClick jacking occurs when a website is loaded via an iframe on the website and the website overlays a different UI on top of the iframed website with pointer-events set to none and then tricks the user into entering information or clicking a button on the overlayed UI but they are actually clicking a button on the iframed website. This is dangerous because the action on the iframed website can be something like sending funds to the attackers wallet.\n\nTo prevent the wallet site to be loaded in an iframe at all, all the wallet site has to do is set the HTTP header X-Frame-Options: DENY, which is what Authereum and Portis are doing so they are safe from these attacks.\n\nTrusting content scripts\n\nIt's easy to verify browser extension source code by using source viewer plugins, but to avoid an extension from auto-updating with malicious code, a user can install the extension manually to lock it down to a version by getting the source code from github if it's open source or from downloading the source scripts.\n\nSince with web-based wallets the wallet site owner controls the content scripts then you have to trust that the content scripts managing the sensitive key data won't be malicious since the wallet site owner or an attacker that got access to the wallet site can at any point update the website source code with bad code. \n\nTo trust content scripts, the wallet site can be hosted on IPFS since the web address is the content hash meaning you can trust that it won't change. Authereum is one wallet that already offers this by visiting authereum.eth or by resolving the contenthash property of their ENS name.\n\nConvenience\n\nWeb-based wallets are portable because you can use the same wallet on any OS, browser, desktop or mobile, while with browser extension you are stuck with the environment you are using the extension from. Extensions are highly inconvenient but offer more storage isolation guarantees. With contract-based accounts however, more security features can be offered on the wallet side. \n\nContract-based accounts\n\nMetaMask, Portis, Torus, and Fortmatic are all externally-owned account based (EOA) which means that funds are stored and manged by a single key. If an attacker gains access to the signing key, then they also have access to the funds stored at that key. \n\nContract-based accounts (CBA), such as Authereum, provide more security guarantees because each account contract can have multiple keys to manage it and each key may also have limited authority over what actions it can do. \n\nAdvantages of contract-based accounts:\n\n\nFunds are not stored on a single key\nYou can cycle through management keys\nAccount recovery, in case your management keys are stolen or lost\nTransfer and withdraw limits \nAccess controls for keys, meaning you can restrict what methods a key can invoke","39":"Make sure you set the correct script for your utxo.\n\nvar utxo = {\n  \"txId\" : \"d095e2e921ac6f0ed5f7f886529c14d662b82feb35e1afa0051a8328855ecdf8\",\n  \"outputIndex\" : 0,\n  \"address\" : address.toString(),\n  \"script\" : \"76a9144093522294655efcbfc2bdfdb448682bf3bef69a88ac\",\n  \/\/ \"script\" : \"76a91447862fe165e6121af80d5dde1ecb478ed170565b88ac\",\n  \"satoshis\" : 100000,\n  \"network\":'testnet'\n};","40":"You can use truffle to interact with your smart contract or retrieve data from it.\n\nLet's say I have a contract looks like this:\n\ncontract MetaCoin {\n    mapping (address => uint) balances;\n\n    ...\n\n    function getBalance(address addr) public view returns(uint) {\n        return balances[addr];\n    }\n}\n\n\nYou can call function getBalance in your javascript code to get the balance of an address with the following code:\n\n\/\/ Interact with truffle contract instance\nlet balance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])\nbalance.toNumber()\n\n\nHere is a more detailed version: interacting with your contract\n\nHere is a brief tutorial on how to build a dapp with truffle: Pet Shop","41":"If you are really interested in learning and diving into Hyperledger Fabric, avoid byfn script.

Please let me list a few of them.\n\nHyperledger Foundation Projects for 2019 - HLD Fabric + HLD Indy\n\nStack Overflow - Communication between HLD Fabric - HLD Indy","92":"Alright, after several hours of investigating history of git commits and INDY's jira I've found INDY-967 ticket.\n\nThere was a request for few additional features that will enhance validator-info usefulness. \n\nRequest:\n\n\n  Indicate the nodes that are the current primaries.  In the verbose human-readable output, this can be indicated by the primary number in parenthesis after the name of the nodes that are primaries, in this fashion:\n\n\nActually there is a comment similar to my OP - why the number has disappeared. And there is an answer for the question as well.\n\n\n  if node is primary for instance and it is disconnected for more than 2-3 min then whole instance is removed. if we do not have instance we cannot have primary for it, so it is expected that unreachable node is not a primary.\n  also it is possible that some instance has no primary during view change\n\n\n\nWhat has happened with the number?\n\n\nThe instance has been disconnected and after few minutes consensus has decided to remove the instance so there is no need to keep the node as primary.\n\n\nWhat does the number mean?\n\n\nThe number indicates primary nodes. The (0) is primary node of 1st BFT protocol instance and (1) is second primary node from second BFT protocol instance - something like backup of (0) as it is defined in RBFT protocol white paper.\n\n\nIs there some delay or why I needed to wait few minutes until (1) for Node2 disappeared.\n\n\nThe delay is a period of time until consensus with new backup BFT protocol instance is reached. The 1 should be assigned to another node. \n\n\nEven after 20+mins the (1) has not been assigned to any of the Reachable hosts. Why?\n\n\nMy current assumption is that until primary BFT instance is the same the consensus and RBFT \/ Indy-Plenum's RBFT doesn't run new \"election\" aka view-change for primary instance or \"round-robin\" assignment with BFT instances. So if the node which is not available had backup primary replica it doesn't matter and doesn't require update of BFT instances.","93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":null,"97":"The problem is that you are calling hashCode() on an array, in your case Object[] object. And since arrays don't override the hashCode() method from the Object class you will get the result from the Object.hashCode() method.

To fix this problem you use the Arrays.deepHashCode() method. It will return the hashcode based on the content of the array.

Once the \nnodes disagree, there is no way to determine true balances, as each node's observations are considered equally valid , a way to bring the nodes back in sync is using consensus algorithms and with blockchain the transactions in this system are never technically \"final\" as a conflicting chain of blocks can always outgrow the current canonical chain, however as blocks are built on top of a transactions, it becomes increasingly unlikely\/costly for another chain to overtake it and hence preventing the double spending problem.","101":"Put simply, Amazon Managed Blockchain is \"traditional\" blockchain whereas Amazon Quantum Ledger Database is something totally different.\n\nFirst, the official definitions:\n\n\n  Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and managing blockchain networks using open source frameworks. Currently, the Hyperledger Fabric open source framework is supported. Blockchain allows you to build applications where multiple parties can securely and transparently run transactions and share data without the need for a trusted, central authority.\n\n\nSo, think of it as providing a traditional blockchain infrastructure.\n\n\n  Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB) is a fully managed ledger database owned by a central trusted authority that provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log of all of your application changes\u00e2\u0080\u008e. Amazon QLDB tracks each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.\n\n\nThis one is quite different. The story is the customers were looking at Blockchain as a way of providing verifiable transactions. Then Amazon realized that this goal does not require a full distributed nature of a blockchain. Instead, it just needs a central database with verifiable transactions.\n\nFor example, a normal database cannot \"prove\" that a transaction has not been changed. DB Admins can always go in and modify a transaction or log to hide something. Amazon QLDB, however, uses blockchain-like verification in each block of transactions to \"prove\" that it hasn't been modified.\n\nHere's a presentation on the topic: AWS re:Invent 2018: [NEW LAUNCH!] Do I need a ledger database?

You can use the Managed Blockchain console to view the metrics for a peer node. Managed Blockchain also reports metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. You can use CloudWatch to set up dashboards, receive alarms, and view log files for peer node metrics.\n\n\nMetrics include:\n\n\nTransactions: The number of transactions that a peer node receives per minute.\nCPUUtilization(%): The percentage of total CPU capacity used on the peer node's Managed Blockchain instance at any given instant.\nMemoryUtilization(%): The percentage of total available memory used on the peer node's Managed Blockchain instance at any given instant.","103":"[Update]\n\nHere are unique benefits one can get with the Intel SGX alongside Hyperledger Sawtooth\n\nPoET Consensus in SGX mode: PoET is a scalable consensus algorithm, if it is configured to run in SGX mode then you get Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) feature. The other BFT algorithms do not scale up to work with larger networks. For example,  PBFT would require a fully connected network in place unlike PoET. Though PBFT is good enough for smaller networks (even 20 nodes).

However the description in the question is oriented in a way to talk about Byzantine Fault Tolerance.\n\nBroadly we can classify Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Crash Fault Tolerance. Byzantine behavior is the unexpected scenario arising because of the node, unpredictable result from the node, it could be intentional (malicious act from a node) or unintentional (machine's memory corruption\/hardware issues). Crash fault tolerance is the high availability of the system, though there can be random node failures in the network.\n\nThere's a general misconception that a Blockchain system should always be Byzantine Fault Tolerant. There can be multiple use cases for the Blockchain system. Choosing what to achieve through Blockchain is thus use case specific.\n\nFor example, in most public networks where there's incentive involved for creating a block in the network and there's no established trust or no means of establishing trust among the participants. A consensus algorithm which provides the Byzantine Fault Tolerance may be opt over there.\n\nAnother use case for the Blockchain is its immutability property, i.e. when a data\/state is added to the Blockchain it becomes highly computationally difficult to modify it. In case of private Blockchain consortium, participants may optionally prove their identity to the other nodes upon request through some other means and immutability property could be of interest to them. It may not matter who wins the election or who creates a block. To give you an instance, in case of Hyperledger Sawtooth with Raft as a consensus engine, leader gets a chance to create a block always. Raft provides Crash Fault Tolerance in the network as long as majority (50%+1) of the nodes are alive.\n\nHyperledger Sawtooth PoET when run on SGX is Byzantine Fault Tolerant and gives all the nodes a fair random chance to construct the block. In case if PoET is run in Simulator mode then it only gives the latter capability. The protection for Byzantine behavior is coming from the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) like Intel SGX.\n\nNote: Blockchain systems are designed so that participants get chance to validate blocks created by the winning node. They add the block to their ledger only after validation. In case of consortium a node will be caught if tries to manipulate and because there can be other means of identifying who is the participant, Byzantine behavior can be caught.\n\nA Blockchain is a distributed design solution, by virtue of its design it provides at the least Crash Fault Tolerance for the system as a whole. Since the same copy of data is replicated across the nodes (at least more than one node), the data is not lost even if there's a failure of one or two nodes in the network. High availability is guaranteed.\n\nI hope these points helped you to move next in your exploration.","238":"You need to serialization it. Serialization is the process of taking a structured set of data and making it into one string, number or vector of bytes that can then be de-serialized later on back into that struct. One method would be to take the hash of the block and use it as the key in the db then crate a new struct which does not contain the hash. Then write a function that takes a Block struct and a path and constructs a BlockNoHash struct and saves it. Then another function to read a block from a hash and spit out a Block Struct.

If a block is considered valid, a full node will broadcast that block.

When communication is restored, the blockchain resolves itself and one of the blockchains is chosen as the \"correct\" blockchain and all nodes sync to the \"correct\" (or chosen) blockchian.","263":null,"264":null,"265":null,"266":null,"267":null,"268":null,"269":null,"270":"you should be able supply it as a parameter to the InstantiateCCRequest struct - specifically CollConfig - you can check out the structure in the Go docs -> https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric-sdk-go\/blob\/master\/pkg\/client\/resmgmt\/resmgmt.go#L69 and the CollectionConfig type is described here -> https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric-sdk-go\/blob\/master\/third_party\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/protos\/common\/collection.pb.go#L69","271":null,"272":null,"273":null,"274":"for my new job I am currently to investigate into blockchain\n\n\nThe main question is why? Why are you looking into blockchain is there a specific application that blockchain is supposed to solve? It is usually not the silver bullet.\n\nAlso the definition of blockchain varies wildly based on context. For example, it may be a chain of blocks, but is there a consensus mechanism? Does it use proof of work, proof of stake, some other mechanism? Is it permissioned or permission-less? Is it public or private? The \"chain of blocks\" technology invented in Bitcoin was designed to provide distributed consensus of transaction data in a public, permission-less system. Any other system doesn't really need that technology.\n\n\n  1.) Very crucial: Where exactly is the DATA of the BLOCKCHAIN stored? Okay, so of course I know that every node in the chain has a copy of the ledger that is constantly updated. But this ledger, as far as my understanding goes, ONLY includes data about TRANSACTIONS, but not the actual data loaded into the blockchain? Or is this the same, since the BLOCKCHAIN can not store, say a \"video\" but only data about bitcoins transactions?\n\n\nBitcoin only stores transaction data (and meta data of each block such as block hash, timestamp, etc.), See Blocks. Some transactions use OP_RETURN scripts which allow storing arbitrary data and has been used to store photos, links, etc., but this has been a topic for debate as to whether it is good for the network to have all of this non-transaction-related data replicated across all full nodes.\n\n\n  2.) Either way, that means that the public blockchain is getting bigger in size by the minute. When every node stores the whole blockchain, it is only a matter of time until it all crashes since no one has enough room to store everything anymore, right?\n\n\nAssuming that data storage technology is stagnant and prices stay the same, yes. But that has obviously not been the case, so the hope is that it scales with the system. Also, you can run a light node, in which case the data is validated, but once it is validated it is discarded (generally speaking).\n\n\n  3.) Regarding smart contracts: It is my understanding that a smart contract is the only way to access the blockchain. If I wanted to set up my own blockchain, what I am doing is programming a smart contract that then accesses a server and loads data into the chain. Is this correct?\n\n\nBitcoin uses a scripting system for determining who can spend bitcoin (like locking it to a key pair, which must provide a valid signature. You can write scripts that could be considered smart contracts. Others like Ethereum have extended the concept for a turing-complete language. To send data (i.e. submit transactions) you must provide a valid transaction that has valid scripts or it will be rejected. \n\n\n  4.) How many \"public\" blockchains exist? Is it just this one? Or is there one public blockchain for every topic? \n\n\nThere are many applications (probably thousands) that say they are a public blockchain, and which use similar (or the exact same) technology as Bitcoin.","275":"The call stub.GetHistoryForKey(userNameIndexKey) will query the state database and not the ledger (channel).

Then you might use a helper method like this to add a participant:\n\nfun addParticipant(partyToAdd: Party): IOUState = copy(participants + partyToAdd)\n\n\nHere's the important part: you must then include the old IOUState as an input to this transaction and the new IOUState as an output. Corda is based on the UTXO model - the only way to update a state is to mark it as history (use it as an input) and then persist an updated version to the ledger. \n\nNote: as a participant, the informed party will now be able to propose changes to this IOUState - these must be accounted for in the Corda Contract.\n\n\nUse the SendStateAndRefFlow (Likely the better solution for your issue)\n\n\nThe SendStateAndRefFlow will (as specified in its name) send a state and its associated stateRef to the receiving node.

That's like saying Mysql is Facebook. It's rather that Facebook uses Mysql as it's database and cryptocurrencies use blockchain as their databases.\n\nThere are several ways blockchains can be used as source of validation:\n\n\nUsing wallet address as \"identity\"\n\nA blockchain \"wallet\" is actually just a number, an integer. But it's a very large one. The address is derived from the user's public key. This is the same system that is used by SSL\/TLS (HTTPS) to secure websites.\n\nWhat you can do is let the user register with your system with his blockchain wallet address (for example Bitcoin wallet or Etheruem wallet). To authenticate the user just have the user sign a piece of data known to you (it could be as simple as the string \"Hello\"). Then using his wallet address you can verify that he is who he says he is because you've proven that he has the private key needed to sign the data. In some ways this is similar to how JWT (JSON Web Token) works but JWT does not use a blockchain.\nUsing a smart contract\n\nSome blockchain platforms such as Ethereum implement a feature known as \"Smart Contracts\". A smart contract is just a fancy name in the blockchain world for a Class that is stored in the blockchain and can interact with the blockchain. Some blockchain platforms such as Corda only allow you to store data in smart contracts and some limited validation logic. Others like Ethereum actually implement Turing-complete smart contracts that allow you to implement any logic.\n\nYou can implement your user data in smart contracts. Then the users will have to call the authentication method in the smart contract using his wallet address. All the regular security mechanisms protecting blockchain transactions are involved so the smart contract has access to the user's identity (address) and users cannot fake a transaction by using another user's address because he does not have other people's private keys. Using this you can implement authentication logic in smart contracts.","309":null,"310":"I installed truffle v5.0.24 and started working on the truffle console which solved all the issues.","311":null,"312":null,"313":null,"314":"It's a way to declare an array with single argument\n\ncontract MyToken is StandaloneERC20 {\n    function initialize(\n        address owner, \n        address minter, \n        address[] memory pausers\n    ) public initializer {\n        address[] memory minters = new address[](1);\n        minters[0] = minter;\n        StandaloneERC20.initialize(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\", uint8(18), minters, pausers);\n    }\n}\n\n\nHere is Solidity docs about Allocating Memory Arrays","315":"Whilst the answer about the enterprise network manager is correct if you wish to purchase the Corda Enterprise Network Manager.  \n\nThe guys over at cordite have built an excellent network-map\/doorman which can be used in private networks: https:\/\/gitlab.com\/cordite\/network-map-service they are also in #cordite on cordaledger slack.\n\nIF you just want to get up and running quickly, there is a pre-built docker image that runs a doorman \/ networkmap using the development keystore available at: https:\/\/github.com\/roastario\/spring-boot-network-map","316":"TL;DR - Peers maintain the ledger and state database for any channels they have joined.\n\nWhen a peer joins a channel, it will receive all the blocks for that channel.

There will be many coins that are actually burned, but not provable, so the actual available currency will be lower than the result obtained.\n\nWhile it is true that coins can be burned or lost, not all can be proven as burned.

Of course, if the transaction has already been mined (included in a block) it will fail validation. This is necessary because unless that one node has a lot of hashpower, it will be very difficult to mine since it would be the only one to know about the transaction. There would also be a lot of conflicts if the mempool wasn't shared.\n\nOn your second question:\n\nWhen you submit a transaction, the wallet software should deduct that from your available balance (assuming it was not rejected). In Bitcoin (and other related currencies), if the transaction is not confirmed (included in a block) within a certain timeframe (Bitcoin is 2 weeks), then it will be removed from the mempool, and the coins are free to spend again.

As such, operations in your app will boil down to the following:\n\n\nCreating accounts on the blockchain\nFunding accounts on the blockchain\nSending payments\n\n\nYou can clone a sample implementation here - or you can follow the steps below to get a basic understanding.\n\nInstallation\n\nCreate an empty Unity project, and install the Kin Unity Plugin and modify your gradle file as described here.\n\nNOTE: The SDK only runs on an Android\/iOS device or emulator. The SDK will not run in the unity editor or unity remote -so you will need to compile and run the code in an emulator or device.\n\nImplementation\n\nCreate an empty MonoBehaviour script - name it KinWrapper, and declare the Kin namespace:\n\n    using Kin;\n\n\nYou can also enable blockchain listeners by adding the following to your MonoBehaviour :\n\n    public class KinWrapper : MonoBehaviour, IPaymentListener, IBalanceListener\n\n\nInstantiating\n\nNext declare instances of the Kin Client and Kin Account\n\n    private KinClient kinClient;\n    private KinAccount kinAccount;\n\n\nThe client handles the native code depending on the platform you are using. (Android or iOS). The account is the main interface you will be using.\n\nCreating an account\n\nBefore using the account, you first have to instantiate it through the client.\n\n    kinClient = new KinClient(Kin.Environment.Test, \"appId\");\n    if (!kinClient.HasAccount()) \n    {\n        kinAccount = kinClient.AddAccount();\n    }else{\n        kinAccount = kinClient.GetAccount(0);\n    }\n\n\nThe code above first checks to see if a local account exists on the device. If it doesn't, it creates an account on the device and returns that as a reference.\n\nNOTE: A 'created account' is simply a public key and private key generated on the device. These local keys enable the device to communicate with the blockchain.\n\nYou can now get the public key (client's blockchain address) by calling:\n\n    kinAccount.GetPublicAddress();\n\n\nOnboarding\/ Funding an account\n\nBecause this key only exists locally, you need to 'on-board' it to the blockchain. In other words, a special function needs to be called, to fund and register it online. Before this step is done, the address is considered invalid on the blockchain, and cannot receive or make transactions. This is part of the stellar protocol to avoid spam and unnecessary account creation.\n\nYou can check if the account has been on-boarded and funded by calling the following function:\n\n    kinAccount.GetStatus(GetStatusCallback)\n    void GetStatusCallback(KinException ex, AccountStatus status)\n    {\n         if (status == AccountStatus.Created)\n         {\n\n         }\n          else\n         {\n\n         }\n    }\n\n\nTo on-board and fund an account on the test blockchain, you have 3 options:\n\nOption 1: You can do this manually by pasting the address on Kin's friend-bot service. This will on-board the account for you automatically.\n\nOption 2: You can call the friend-bot through your code as an http request\nhttps:\/\/friendbot-testnet.kininfrastructure.com\/?addr=address_here\n\n    public static IEnumerator FundAccount( string publicAddress, Action<bool> onComplete = null )\n    {\n        var url = \"http:\/\/friendbot-testnet.kininfrastructure.com\/?addr=\" + publicAddress;\n        var req = UnityWebRequest.Get( url );\n\n        yield return req.SendWebRequest();\n\n        if( req.isNetworkError || req.isHttpError )\n        {\n            Debug.Log( req.error );\n            if( onComplete != null )\n                onComplete( false );\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.Log( \"response code: \" + req.responseCode );\n            Debug.Log( req.downloadHandler.text );\n            if( onComplete != null )\n                onComplete( true );\n        }\n    }\n\n\nOption 3: You can use server side code to fund it yourself (which you must do in a production environment). Basically, your client will need to call your server and request to be on-boarded. Your server can then use Kin's python SDK or node SDK to perform the on-boarding.\n\nHere is a handy  python implementation or Node.js implementation  you can use for your server.\n\nCalling the implementation from Unity is as simple as follows:\n\n    public IEnumerator FundMe(decimal amount, Action<bool> fundCallback = null)\n    {\n        WWWForm form = new WWWForm();\n        form.AddField(\"address\", kinAccount.GetPublicAddress());\n        form.AddField(\"amount\", amount.ToString());\n        reqUrl = \"http:\/\/address.to.your.server\";\n        var req = UnityWebRequest.Post(reqUrl, form);\n        yield return req.SendWebRequest();\n\n        if (req.isNetworkError || req.isHttpError)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(req.error);\n            fundCallback(false);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            fundCallback(true);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nNOTE: Kin has two blockchains. Production and Test. The test blockchain merely has \"play currency\" that you can run tests on without incurring costs. The production blockchain has real world value Kin\n\nCalling Other Functions\n\nGetBalance()\n\n    account.GetBalance(GetBalanceCallback);\n    void GetBalanceCallback(KinException ex, decimal balance)\n    {\n        if (ex == null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log( \"Balance: \" + balance );\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError( \"Get Balance Failed. \" + ex );\n        }\n    }\n\n\nDeleteAccount()\n\n    kinClient.DeleteAccount(0);\n\n\nNOTE: GetBalance() needs a callback because it's communicating with the blockchain online. DeleteAccount() doesn't because it simply deletes the private and public keys on the client. Once deleted, these keys can not be recovered.\n\nHandling transactions\n\nTransactions have the following parameters:\n\n\nMemo: an optional string with extra information.\nAddress: the address of the recipient\nAmount: amount of Kin you are sending (excluding fees)\nFee: the fee you will pay for your transaction to be processed by the blockchain. The current fee is 100\/100000 KIN. This fee protects the blockchain from spam.\n\n\nNOTE: The fee is denominated in the smallest unit of Kin. (Quark). Just like the smallest unit of a dollar is a cent. So when calling a transaction, set the fee to 100 (quarks) - which is 100\/100000 KIN. Setting the fee tells the blockchain you are explicitly agreeing to pay the transaction fee. If you set the fee too low, your transaction will be rejected.\n\nYou can view all transactions on Kin's blockchain at: https:\/\/laboratory.kin.org\/index.html#explorer?resource=payments\n\nTo send a payment, first build the transaction locally :\n\n    kinAccount.BuildTransaction(address, amount, fee, memo, BuildTransactionCallBack);\n\n\nBuilding a transaction performs several operations on the client to authorise it and sign it. After the transaction is built, use the following callback to send it to Kin's blockchain.\n\n    void BuildTransactionCallBack(KinException ex, Transaction transaction)\n    {\n        if (ex == null)\n        {\n            kinAccount.SendTransaction(transaction, SendTransactionCallback);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Build Transaction Failed. \" + ex);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nOnce you have sent the transaction to Kin's blockchain, you can listen for the response, to make sure it went through correctly. A transaction typically takes less than 10 seconds to complete.\n\n    void SendTransactionCallback(KinException ex, String transactionId)\n    {\n        if (ex == null)\n        {\n            \/\/Success\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Send Transaction Failed. \" + ex);\n        }\n    }\n\n\nNOTE: You should use co-routines for functions that need to wait. This will prevent your code from hanging while waiting for responses, and will create a better user experience.\n\nSending transactions with zero fees\n\nYou can send transactions with zero fees by being whitelisted by the Kin Foundation. To get whitelisted, simply register with the Kin Developer Program. Once approved, you can perform an extra step to let your client send transactions with zero fees.\n\nTo send a zero-fee transaction after building the transaction:\n\n\nThe client will need to contact your whitelisted server.\nYour server will approve\/ sign the transaction and send it back to the client.\nThe client will then send this approved transaction to Kin's blockchain, and it will be processed for free.\n\n\nWe have already built the transaction, now we whitelist it\n\n    void BuildTransactionCallBack(KinException ex, Transaction transaction)\n    {\n        if (ex == null)\n        {\n            StartCoroutine(WhitelistTransaction(transaction, WhitelistTransactionCallback))\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Build Transaction Failed. \" + ex);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nWe are calling our whitelisted server to authorise the transaction\n\n    IEnumerator WhitelistTransaction(Transaction transaction, Action<string, string> onComplete)\n    {\n        var postDataObj = new WhitelistPostData(transaction);\n        var postData = JsonUtility.ToJson(postDataObj);\n        var rawPostData = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(postData);\n\n        \/\/ UnityWebRequest does not work correclty when posting a JSON string so we use a byte[] and a hacky workaround\n        var req = UnityWebRequest.Post(baseURL + whitelistURL, \"POST\");\n        req.SetRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application\/json\");\n        req.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(rawPostData);\n\n        yield return req.SendWebRequest();\n\n        if (req.isNetworkError || req.isHttpError)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(req.error);\n            onComplete(null, null);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            onComplete(req.downloadHandler.text, transaction.Id);\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nOur server has approved the transaction and sent back a signed string.

You can also use the node.js SDK.\n\nListening to events on the blockchain\n\nYou can add listeners to prevent your client from over-querying the blockchain.

It's perfectly\n    \/\/\/ reasonable for this to be an identity conversion (with the source type being `AccountId`), but other modules\n    \/\/\/ (e.g. Indices module) may provide more functional\/efficient alternatives.\n    type Lookup: StaticLookup<Target = Self::AccountId>;\n\n    \/\/\/ The block header.\n    type Header: ...\n\n    \/\/\/ The aggregated event type of the runtime.\n    type Event: Parameter + Member + From<Event>;\n\n    \/\/\/ A piece of information that can be part of the digest (as a digest item).\n    type Log: From<Log<Self>> + Into<DigestItemOf<Self>>;\n}\n\n\nIn your custom module, you will define something like:\n\n\/\/\/ The module's configuration trait.\npub trait Trait: system::Trait {\n    \/\/\/ The overarching event type.\n    type Event: From<Event<Self>> + Into<<Self as system::Trait>::Event>;\n}\n\n\nNote here that we have defined our own Event type, which our module can now use, but also we have inherited the traits from the system module (system::Trait), so we can also use all those types too!\n\nUsing Generic Types\n\nNow that we have defined some custom types in our runtime module, we can start to use them throughout our module logic.\n\nYou will always see a line like the second line in this code snippet:\n\ndecl_storage! {\n    trait Store for Module<T: Trait> as Sudo {\n        \/\/\/ The `AccountId` of the sudo key.\n        Key get(key) config(): T::AccountId;\n    }\n}\n\n\nSome of this line is macro magic, but importantly you see we define Module<T: Trait>. This means we have assigned our module's trait Trait as the generic parameter for Module under the alias of T.\n\nThus, we can then use T to reference these special types like we did above:\n\nT::AccountId\n\n\nGoing full circle, we can access this type because we have inherited it from the system::Trait definition!\n\nDeposit Event Macro Generation\n\nTo finally answer your question, the decl_module! function generates the function body of the deposit_event to save you from writing the same code over and over.\n\nWe detect the pre-defined function name deposit_event, and check for = default;, and then replace that with a working deposit_event function.\n\nHowever, when generating this function, the macro does not know if it should use a function where the input event is generic, or the input event does not use generics. Thus, you need to \"give it a hint\" by saying deposit_event<T>() or just deposit_event().\n\nIt will then produce the right version of the function which will work with the types in your module. If your module events uses any generic types, like T::AccountId or T::Balance, you will also need to define the generic version of deposit_event.","384":null,"385":null,"386":null,"387":"The oo7 Substrate library exposes the addCodecTransform() function which enables you to define custom types which you can then use within the UI.\n\nFor example, given this structure defined in your module:\n\n#[derive(Encode, Decode, Default, Clone, PartialEq)]\n#[cfg_attr(feature = \"std\", derive(Debug))]\npub struct Kitty<Hash, Balance> {\n    id: Hash,\n    dna: Hash,\n    price: Balance,\n    gen: u64,\n}\n\n\nYou could make the following JavaScript call:\n\naddCodecTransform('Kitty<Hash,Balance>', { \n    id: 'Hash',\n    dna: 'Hash',\n    price: 'Balance',\n    gen: 'u64'\n});\n\n\nIf you add this do your applications constructor() function, you can make sure that it is called before your dependent React functions require it.","388":"Recently, Substrate changed the default cryptography for accounts and transactions signing from ed25519 to sr25519.\n\nDepending on what combination of software you are using (node, UI, etc...) and what local storage items you have stored (like accounts in your UI) you may end up with some incompatible combination of accounts and cryptography.\n\nSo first thing to note:\n\nAll the accounts initiated in the genesis configuration, like Alice, use sr25519.

By participants, I mean organisations. An Organisation joins a channel, then it adds peers to it.\n\nREST APIs are built around peers, as in one REST API per peer. So yes, in theory you can scale, just spin up another peer, create the API, etc, all this can be done automatically, via scripts. Your main issues is knowing when there is too much traffic and when to start spinning up new ones. Also, you might spin up a new one, but how is your app supposed to know a new endpoint is available? \n\nI suppose you could build a facade system and when your scripts spin a new peer and expose a new API, at that point this could be reported to the app so it maintains a list of available APIs, it just sounds like a lot of work for virtually no gain.\n\nI have to wonder, why didn't you simply build a normal API, put it in a cloud, let it scale automatically with built-in tools, job done?\n\nAll this aside, if it's too late to change now, maybe you can do it in a different way. Your app could be talking to a queuing system and this is the one pushing the votes to a peer, when available. If it's not available, it can wait, it just means the votes will come in a bit later. So your app doesn't directly talk to the REST APIs, sends messages with votes to a queue, then you have another app which monitors this queue and uses the REST APIs, if they are up. You could even implement a system, where you decide how many votes you send in 1 go, over a period of time or whatever.

I've turned to Indy community and got to know that this part of the walkthrough tutorial is a bit outdated. Quoting Stephen Curran from Hyperledger Indy's RocketChat channel:\n\n\n  The pairwise DID concept had not been fleshed out enough and so all\n  DIDs in code were being written to the ledger.\n\n\nTo elaborate on public and pairwise DIDs bit more:\n\nNYM Transaction write a DID with associated Verkey (a public part of keypair). You have to however distinguish between public DID and pairwise DID. \n\n\nPublic DID - is identifier which you publish out there for everyone to know. If you are an institution, you want to have such identifier. People\/their devices can then use it to establish the initial secure connection with the institution.\nPairwise DID - is DID which identifies secure channel you've establish with someone. For example, if once you've contacted an institution using their public DID, they would generate pairwise DID (a key pair and DID identifier) for talking with you. You would also generate pairwise DID to identify connection to them (and to encrypt the communication using the keys associated with the pairwise DID)\n\n\n Question 2\n\n\nI think you are referring to the step 10:\n\n\n\n  Faber asks the ledger for the Verification key of the Steward's DID\n  by calling did.key_for_did.\n\n\nSo here Faber reads Steward's DID and its associated verkey (a public key) from the ledger. Faber then uses this key to encrypt the message - the message won't be decryptable by anyone but the Steward, holder of the private part for that verkey.\n\nQuestion 3\n\nHere's how connections are typically established:\n\nSome secure channel is assumed to be established by which one party receive connection invite from the other. You could get for example invite via HTTPS, or simply by employee of a bank presenting you a QR code containing the invite for connection from a Bank. \nWhen generating the connection invite message, the inviting party generates pairwise DID with verkey. This is included in the invite message, so assuming you got this invite secured delivered by any means, it's safe to say you can send encrypted messages to the inviting party.\nAt this point, you would generate your pairwise DID and Verkey for this connection and send this data to the inviter. At this point, you have established secure connection because you both securely exchanged each other's pairwise DIDs\/Verkeys for the session.","483":null,"484":"If the ABCI app logic processing the Commit message sends a broadcast_tx_sync or broadcast_tx_commit and waits for the response before proceeding, it will deadlock. \n\nExecuting those broadcast_tx calls involves acquiring a lock that is held during the Commit call, so it's not possible.\n\nIf you make the call to the broadcast_tx endpoints concurrently, that's no problem, it just can't be part of the sequential logic of the Commit message","485":"this line {-# STDLIB_VERSION 2 #-} stands for the standard library version(the latest version is STDLIB_VERSION 3) which is important to include ride4dapps standard functionality(built-in functions) and the Postfix notation.\n\nthis line {-# CONTENT_TYPE EXPRESSION #-} represents the type of a contract which is \n\n\nEXPRESSION for smart accounts and smart assets.\nDAPP for ride4dApps.\n\n\nThe last line {-# SCRIPT_TYPE ACCOUNT #-} represents the script type, which is:\n\n\nASSET for smart assets script.\nACCOUNT for smart accounts and ride4dApps scripts.","486":"If you use Waves transactions api, the request should be signed already and you can post it to \/transactions\/broadcast.

The sponsorship is set by giving the rate at which fee in an asset is converted to WAVES.\n\n\nSmart Contracts Transactions\n\n\nSet Script Transaction: you can use it to set so up an smart account so this transaction sets the script which verifies all outgoing transactions.\nSet Asset Script Transaction: you can use it to change a smart asset\u00e2\u0080\u0099s script and only the issuer of that asset  can change the asset's script.\nInvoke Script Transaction: you can use it to invoke functions in your smart contract.\n\n\nTransaction versions\n\nThere are two versions of transactions (V1,V2), in the new version the transactions are signed by proofs instead of using a signature.

Each proof is a Base58 encoded byte string and can be a signature, a secret, or anything else \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the semantics of a proof is dictated by the smart contract that interprets it.

However, the bootstrapping process of the Azure Ethereum Proof-of-Authority template does not prealocate any Ether to any pre-allocated accounts in the Chain Specification (genesis) file. Therefore, there is no Ether to begin with. \n\nThe primary reasoning behind this is that Ether serves no purpose in a private Ethereum network unless Proof-of-Work consensus is being used. Proof-of-Work in Ethereum natively requires gas to send transactions and thus the Ether equivalent of gas is necessary to transact on the network. With Proof-of-Authority consensus enabled, there are no gas costs, and thus Ether is not required. \n\n\n  If it is possible would it be a customized version of the Ether only usable in my network and not affected by the value of the currency?\n\n\nThe Ether used on this network would belong solely to this network and has no use on any other Ethereum-based blockchain network.\n\n\n  Can I programmatically create Etherum wallets for users that sign up in my system and load Ether coins into their wallets?\n\n\nAgain, technically, yes. However, this is where I disagree with the above answer. Accounts should not be created directly as part of the network aside from the initial bootstrapped Validator nodes. Accounts should be created programmatically (using a library akin to ethereumjs-wallet) or managed by an external wallet such as MetaMask. In fact, the Azure Ethereum PoA documentation outlines that it is insecure to unlock the personal API for account creation and that accounts should be pre-signing transactions outside of the network.\n\nAlthough, again, there is no initial supply of Ether on the network and this would require you re-writing the Chain Specification and re-bootstrapping the network which is not the intention behind the Azure PoA template.","650":null,"651":"It depends on whether the notary is validating or non-validating.\n\nIf the notary is validating, it will verify any transactions it receives as part of FinalityFlow.

Thanks a lot especially for pointing out the two different types of certificates in fabric.

When I posted the question, I was looking for a technically way to validate whether a signature was signed during the validity of its signing certificate. Then I found the method called Time Stamping Signatures, which yields a trusted Time Stamp Authority to sign our data with a trusted timestamp.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0WayChan\n                \n                Dec 31, 2019 at 7:54,Time stamping the signatures seems to be a good way, but I'm not sure what's the fabric way to validate such signatures.

In Python, the statement if a = 1: will result in a syntax error. In Javascript however, this syntax is valid and will internally resolve to true (try if (a = 1) console.log(true); else console.log(false);).

You can store a blockchain in a database, if you want. Also, you don't need blockchain to do authentication with a wallet address, that's just digital signature verification. If you want to prove someone own's an address so you can verify a transaction was made by them, or that they own some coins, then that might be useful.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0JBaczuk\n                \n                Jun 17, 2019 at 15:37,@JBaczuk Technically, a data structure stored on disk is a database.

In a practical scenario, lets say I have 3 Orgs - Org A, B and C as a part of a Channel. For few specific transactions, I want to have endorsements from Orgs A and B because these transactions are of high interest to A and B. But for few other transactions, I might want endorsements from Orgs A and C because these transactions are of high interest to A and C. Does this scenario make sense? If so, what would be a good approach to have transaction type specific endorsement policies?

But, this would end up being the endorsement policy for that key for all the transactions related to that key. I will not be able to achieve different endorsement policy for each transaction type for a single key. 2) If I start setting endorsement policies differently for each key, say, I have 10000 keys, I would have to set endorsement policy for each one of them. Simpler way would be to set endorsement policy based on transaction type, if that's possible.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Raman Kishore\n                \n                Jun 6, 2019 at 9:19,Also it's not possible.

(2) Sometimes, you would want to keep your smart contract code private, if you have some secret logic you don't want people to find out, or it can be that you don't trust someone else's code to run on your peers, even if it's inside a container.

So storing data in blockchain will cost you some amount. Every time you store a product it will cost you, further whenever you want to update the product quantity it will also cost you some amount.

Now if the issuer verification services are down\/hacked\/tampered, There is no way to verify the DL.\nBut if the same identity (DL) is issued using Blockchain Network e.g Hyperledger Indy, the Issuer ( Driving License Authority) will issue a verifiable credential (DL) to a user(citizen) and stored a signing key\/pub key in a DID which is stored in a decentralized ledger which can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be tampered and act as a single source of truth.\nOne important thing to note that, Verifiable credentials are stored in the user's mobile wallet, not in Blockchain.\nSo when the user presents a DL from his mobile wallet, Car rental company fetches the verification public key from the decentralized ledger and verify the records without ever contacting Driving License Issuing Authority.\nBlockchain provides two key significant benefits:\nThe issuer will be eliminated from verifying process, thus saving time, cost, and bureaucracy while maintaining the same level of trust and transparency.\nIdentities will be citizen-centric, not Issuer-centric.\nYou can read more about it here if interested in Hyperledger based Decentralise identity.","87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":null,"93":null,"94":null,"95":"I resolved this by adding the build folder to tsconfig.json exclude.\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \/\/ ...\n  },\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"node_modules\",\n    \"dist\" \/\/ <-- this resolves the issue\n  ]\n}","96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":null,"100":null,"101":null,"102":null,"103":null,"104":null,"105":null,"106":null,"107":null,"108":null,"109":null,"110":null,"111":null,"112":null,"113":null,"114":null,"115":null,"116":null,"117":null,"118":"I know this is an old one, but for anyone hung on this one now, what solved this for me was downgrading to node v10.24.1 & npm v6.14.12.

It is about Private Data. Private data gives you the possibility to 'label' data with a time to live. Then only the private data hashes are stored on the chain (to be able to verify this transaction) but the data itself is stored in so called SideDBs and gets fully pruned (except the hashes on the chain of course). This is kind of the basis for using Fabric without workarounds and achieving GDPR.\n\nThe other thing, which was not mentioned yet and kind of is very helpful to this question \n\n\n  Is there a way to backup and purge a blockchain or delete items older than some time frame?\n\n\nEvery peer only stores the 'current state' of the ledger in his StateDB. The current state could be described as the data which is labeled 'active' and probably soon to be used again. You can think of the StateDB being like a Cache. Every Data is comes into this Cache by creating or updating a new key (invoking). To remove a key from the Cache you can use 'DelState'. So it is labeled 'deleted' and not in the Cache anymore. BUT it is still on the ledger! and you can retrieve the history and data to that key.\n\nConclusion: For 'real' deleting of data you have to use the concept of Private Data and for managing data in your StateDB (think of the 'Cache' analogy) you can simply use built in functions.","462":null,"463":null,"464":"I got the same error.

          OK, you'll now. I have ever avoided byfn, so I don't really know what it performs. It is the best way to start with Hyperledger Fabric quickly without learning anything. I build my networks manually. As long as your docker services are not persisting the state in volumes or .\/byfn down clears the volumes, it is OK.

The steps on down command are: Bring down the network, deleting the volumes, Delete any ledger backups, Cleanup the chaincode containers, cleanup images, remove orderer block and other channel configuration transactions and certs, remove the docker-compose yaml file that was customized to the example.
