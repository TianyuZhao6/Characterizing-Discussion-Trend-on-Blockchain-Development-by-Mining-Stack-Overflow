Description":{"0":"I was wondering if somebody could give me some guidance. I am trying to get blockchain.info server answers me back with the current block number and the hash of it but honestly I have no idea how to do it. I wanted to do it using html & javascript and I was reading that I have to use JSONP or CORS for it to work but I still don't have an idea of how to make it work. If you could help me out I would really appreciate it.","1":"Im trying to send bitcoins using Blockchain.info API to both adresses in 'recipes':\n\nrecipes ={'1Pd9gXJ8EqyGrqMKVevQWNjjF4B4dcSykf':10000,'14gVMjoCbjaGU3s9EQghVxYTAJgkmqqtHV':10000}\n\n\nMy request looks like:\n\nurl_multi = 'https:\/\/blockchain.info\/nl\/merchant\/MYKEY\/sendmany?password=MYPASSWORD&recipients='+recipes+'&fee=15000'\n\nrequests.get(url_multi)\n\n\nI managed to send txs to single adresses using the examples in the documentation.\nHowever, sending to multiple adresses at once requires a dict according to the PHP-example.\n\nIn Python, the following Typerror gets returned; TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'dict' objects \n\nHow do I add multiple recipients to the request without using a dict?","2":"I want to have a bitcoin gateway on my site.\nI downloaded blockchain api source it seems to work well.\nblockchain api source:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/blockchain\/receive_payment_php_demo\nwhen I click on that payment button's image , it creates an wallet address for me on blockchain.\nAnd everything is fine .\nBut my question is , how long my user can pay btc into that wallet address and what is its expire time?\nIf my user pay btc to that wallet address but that address was not valid anymore, what will be happened on my users money.","3":"This question could go into a bitcoin forum but I am trying to understand from a programming point of view.\n\nThere are technologies used for distributed storage, like distributed hashtables (say kademlia or similar). How is the bitcoin blockchain different from distributed hashtables? Or is maybe distributed hashtable technology underpinning the bitcoin blockchain? Or why is the bitcoin blockchain hailed as such a breakthrough compared to DHT?","4":"I am trying to create wallet on Blockchain using Ajax but I am getting \"Cross-Origin Request Blocked\" error. My Ajax call is:\n\n$.ajax({\n                    type: 'POST',\n                    url: 'https:\/\/blockchain.info\/api\/v2\/create_wallet',\n                    data: \"cors=true&email=\"+email+\"&password=\"+password+\"&api_code=\"+code,\n                     dataType:'json',\ncrossDomain: true,\n                     beforeSend:function(){\n\n\n                      },\n                    success: function (data) {\n\n                    }\n            });\n\n\nWhen I post this I get error Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https:\/\/blockchain.info\/api\/v2\/create_wallet. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.\n\nOn Blockchain they say that Some API calls are available with CORS headers if you add a cors=true parameter to the request\n\nI have tried everything, I have tried to send this parameter as a GET as well as POST parameter, I have tried jsonp. I have also tried with the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin * but nothing seems to be working. Can anyone confirm if he managed to create blockchain wallet using Ajax call or they don't support CORS for this. Any help will be much appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nHamza","5":"I want to parse the timestamps from the JSON responses from blockchain.info's API.\n\nHere is an example snippet https:\/\/blockchain.info\/api\/api_websocket\n\nSo if we look at\n\n\"time\": 1331300839,\n\n\nI try and do something like\n\nvar test = new Date(1331300839);\ntest.getFullYear();\n\n\nAnd my results are circa 1970. I've tried using the Date object to parse recent Bitcoin transactions.. say https:\/\/blockchain.info\/rawaddr\/1Hy8LSovPiT3Z4qF7Hr2piJXZFHzpSBaEK And I'm still getting 1970.\n\nSo how do I get a human readable output from these timestamps?\n\nThanks.","6":"I am trying to write a python script that will take a bitcoin address and show how many transactions have processed against that address. I can pull the JSON data down and print it to the screen but I can not figure out how to actually make it so that I go into that data and pull out \"n_tx\" potion. Here is what I have so far, basic but it shows I am pulling the right data. \n\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nr = requests.get('http:\/\/blockchain.info\/rawaddr\/1MtKaahhBAwc1Bs9JLgh2tTAmvHL4kauRb')\n\nprint r.json()\n\n\nI have read several tutorials and tried lots of different ideas and I am sure it is a simple fix my brain just can't grasp it today. \n\nUltimately I would like to end up with the following on my screen: \n1MtKaahhBAwc1Bs9JLgh2tTAmvHL4kauRb has 0 transactions\n\nThanks in advance.","7":"I think something like this is possible, but I'm a little fuzzy on the details.  As I understand it:\n\n\nI have one or more bitcoin addresses\nUsers send bits to that address\nUsers can log into my app by providing proof that they control the address that sent (a sufficient number of) bits to my address\n\n\nWhat I'm not clear on is how the proof part works.  How do users generate that proof, and what do I do to validate it?\n\nAlso, do I have to keep a full copy of the blockchain on my server to do this, or are there APIs available?\n\nThanks!","8":"I'm trying to keep subscribed to blockchain.info websocket api for new blocks.

The keys are distributed among nodes with a\ndeterministic algorithm. Each node is responsible for a portion of\nthe hash table.\n\nA routing algorithm allows to perform requests in the hash table\nwithout knowing every node of the network.\n\nFor exemple in the Chord\nDHT \u00e2\u0080\u0094which is relatively simple DHT implementation\u00e2\u0080\u0094 each\nnode is assigned an identifier and is responsible of keys which\nare closer to its identifier.\n\nImagine there is 4 nodes that have identifiers: 2a6c, 7811, a20f, e9c3\nThe data with the identifier 2c92 will be stored on the node 2a6c.\n\nImagine now that you only know the node 7811 and you are looking\nfor the data with the identifier eabc.\n\nYou ask the node 7811 for the data eabc. 7811 doesn't have it so\nit ask the node e9c3 wich send it to node 7811 which send it back\nto you.\n\nA clever algorithm allows to find data in O(log(N))\njumps. Without storing the entire routing table of the\nnetwork (the addresses of each nodes). Basically you ask the\nclosest node to the data identifier you know wich itself asks the\nclosest node it knows and so on reducing the size of the jump at\neach step.\n\nA DHT is very scalable because the data are uniformly distributed\namong nodes and lookup time generally grows in O(log(N)).\n\nBlockchain\n\nA blockchain is also a distributed data structure but its purpose\nis completely different.\n\nThink of it as a history, or a ledger. The purpose is to store a\ncontinuously-growing list of record  without the possibility of\ntampering and revision.\n\nIt is mainly used in the bitcoin currency system for keeping\ntrack of transactions. Its property of being tamper-proof let everybody\nknow the exact balance of an account by knowing its history of\ntransaction.\n\nIn a blockchain, each node of the network stores the full data.\nSo it is absolutely not the same idea as the DHT in which data\nare divided among nodes.  Every new entry in the blockchain must\nbe validated by a process called mining whose details are out of the scope of this answer but this process insure consensus of the\ndata.\n\nThe two structures are both distributed data structure but serve\ndifferent purposes. DHT aims to provide an efficient (in term of\nlookup time and storage footprint) structure to divide data on a\nnetwork and blockchain aims to provide a tamper-proof data\nstructure.","4":"I think it is safe to say that blockchain does not support CORS for their wallet API.\n\nYour AJAX call above looks correct and you are getting a CORS blocked error.\n\nAnd unlike some of their other APIs, the blockchain wallet API docs at https:\/\/blockchain.info\/api\/blockchain_wallet_api do not specify that calls are available via CORS with the cors=true query parameter.\n\nThere are some significant security implications when dealing with private keys and passwords in the browser using javascript.  I suspect that is why they do not allow it.","5":"IF you wanna format date and times, probably the best light-weight library that you can find out there is moment.js\n\nvar parsed = moment.unix(1331300839)\n\n\nNow to format this moment instance, just use the format that you want from this list: http:\/\/momentjs.com\/docs\/#\/displaying\/  or use the very simple yet powerful moment.toString() or moment.fromNow()\n\nparsed.toString()\n\/\/ \"Fri Mar 09 2012 14:47:19 GMT+0100\"\n\nparsed.fromNow()\n\/\/ \"2 years ago\"","6":"Do you mean something like this ??\n\nprint r.json()['address'],' has ', r.json()['n_tx'], 'transactions'","7":"It is possible to implement a pseudo-anonymous login system using a signed bitcoin transaction as proof of payment. The basic idea is that users can prove that they control a specific bitcoin address by signing a message with the private key associated with that address.\nTo do this, users would need to have a bitcoin wallet that allows them to sign messages. They would then sign a message with their private key and provide the signed message and the address it was signed with as proof.\nOn your end, you would need to have a way to validate the signed message. This can be done by using a bitcoin library or API that allows you to verify the signature and check that it was signed with the correct private key associated with the address provided.\nYou would not necessarily need to keep a full copy of the blockchain on your server, but you would need access to the blockchain data to verify the transactions and confirm that the user has sent a sufficient number of bitcoins to your address. This can be done through various bitcoin libraries or APIs that provide access to blockchain data without the need to run a full node.","8":"I just tested this, and it seems to work:\n\n<script src=\"\/\/cdnjs.cloudflare.com\/ajax\/libs\/jquery\/2.0.3\/jquery.min.js\"><\/script>\n\n<script>\n\n$(document).ready\n(\n    function(){\n\n        initWebSocket();\n    }\n);\n<\/script>\n\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\nfunction initWebSocket()\n{\n    \/\/  init blockchain websocket (activity, blocks)\n    var blockchain = new WebSocket('ws:\/\/ws.blockchain.info:8335\/inv');\n\n    blockchain.onerror = function (error){ console.log('connection.onerror',error); };\n\n    blockchain.onopen = function () \n    {\n        blockchain.send( JSON.stringify( {\"op\":\"unconfirmed_sub\"} ) );  \/\/  subscribe to uncofirmed activity\n    };\n\n    blockchain.onmessage = function (message) \n    {\n        var response = JSON.parse(message.data);\n\n        var date = new Date(0);\n        date.setUTCSeconds( response.x.time );\n\n        if( response.op == \"utx\")\n        {\n            var amount = 0;\n\n            for(var i=0;i<response.x.out.length;i++) \n                amount += response.x.out[i].value;\n\n            \/\/  amount is in satoshi\n            \/\/  1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshi (https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/activity)\n            response.amount = amount \/ 100000000;\n        }\n\n\n            console.log( response.op, response );\n\n\n\n    };\n}\n\n\nLargely taken from here: http:\/\/bl.ocks.org\/npedrini\/6030317","9":"The reason you don't get the result you expected is due to encoding.\n\nThe correct code for Python 2\n\nimport util\nhash = '62e907b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f18'\nprint util.hash_to_address(\"00\".decode('hex'), hash.decode('hex'))\n\n\nThe correct code for Python 3\n\nimport util\nimport binascii\nhash = '62e907b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f18'\nprint util.hash_to_address(binascii.unhexlify(\"00\"), binascii.unhexlify(hash))\n\n\nThe decode and unhexlify functions convert the hexadecimal ASCII representations into binary byte strings. \n\nThe problem you were having was that the hash of the binary string and the hash of its hexadecimal ASCII representation are two different hashs.","10":"you may figure out in a simple manner :\n\ngo there http:\/\/json2csharp.com\/ paste your json and it will make your class and its dependency.\n\nthen you may create your new one in your app and the use simply javascript.serialize,deserialize nothing else and it will work perfectly\n\nhere below a fully work console application example working perfectly:\n\nImports System.Net\nImports System.IO\nImports System.Configuration\nImports System.Web.Script.Serialization\n\nModule Module1\n    Dim js As New JavaScriptSerializer\n\n    Sub Main()\n\n    Dim json As String = String.Empty\n\n    Using sr As New StreamReader(\"C:\\Users\\Giorgio\\Desktop\\GOOGLEDRIVE\\hpc\\PROGETTI VS PERSONALI\\VISUALSTUDIOPROJECT\\2014\\Smples\\Smples\\json.txt\")\n        json = sr.ReadToEnd\n    End Using\n    Dim separator As String = \"**********************************************************\"\n    Dim root As RootObject = js.Deserialize(Of RootObject)(json)\n\n    For Each el In root.addresses\n        Console.WriteLine(String.Format(\"{0}\" & vbCrLf & \"{1}\" & vbCrLf & \"{2}\" & vbCrLf & \"{3}\" & vbCrLf & separator, el.address, el.balance, el.label, el.total_received))\n    Next\n\n\n        Console.ReadLine()\nEnd Sub\n\n\nPublic Class Address\n    Public Property balance() As Integer\n        Get\n            Return m_balance\n        End Get\n        Set(value As Integer)\n            m_balance = Value\n        End Set\n    End Property\n    Private m_balance As Integer\n    Public Property address() As String\n        Get\n            Return m_address\n        End Get\n        Set(value As String)\n            m_address = Value\n        End Set\n    End Property\n    Private m_address As String\n    Public Property label() As String\n        Get\n            Return m_label\n        End Get\n        Set(value As String)\n            m_label = Value\n        End Set\n    End Property\n    Private m_label As String\n    Public Property total_received() As Object\n        Get\n            Return m_total_received\n        End Get\n        Set(value As Object)\n            m_total_received = Value\n        End Set\n    End Property\n    Private m_total_received As Object\nEnd Class\n\nPublic Class RootObject\n    Public Property addresses() As List(Of Address)\n        Get\n            Return m_addresses\n        End Get\n        Set(value As List(Of Address))\n            m_addresses = Value\n        End Set\n    End Property\n    Private m_addresses As List(Of Address)\nEnd Class\n\n\nEnd Module\n\nI hope it can help you\nRegards","11":"I don't recommend to get all details at once.

The keys are distributed among nodes with a\ndeterministic algorithm. Each node is responsible for a portion of\nthe hash table.\n\nA routing algorithm allows to perform requests in the hash table\nwithout knowing every node of the network.\n\nFor exemple in the Chord\nDHT \u00e2\u0080\u0094which is relatively simple DHT implementation\u00e2\u0080\u0094 each\nnode is assigned an identifier and is responsible of keys which\nare closer to its identifier.\n\nImagine there is 4 nodes that have identifiers: 2a6c, 7811, a20f, e9c3\nThe data with the identifier 2c92 will be stored on the node 2a6c.\n\nImagine now that you only know the node 7811 and you are looking\nfor the data with the identifier eabc.\n\nYou ask the node 7811 for the data eabc. 7811 doesn't have it so\nit ask the node e9c3 wich send it to node 7811 which send it back\nto you.\n\nA clever algorithm allows to find data in O(log(N))\njumps. Without storing the entire routing table of the\nnetwork (the addresses of each nodes). Basically you ask the\nclosest node to the data identifier you know wich itself asks the\nclosest node it knows and so on reducing the size of the jump at\neach step.\n\nA DHT is very scalable because the data are uniformly distributed\namong nodes and lookup time generally grows in O(log(N)).\n\nBlockchain\n\nA blockchain is also a distributed data structure but its purpose\nis completely different.\n\nThink of it as a history, or a ledger. The purpose is to store a\ncontinuously-growing list of record  without the possibility of\ntampering and revision.\n\nIt is mainly used in the bitcoin currency system for keeping\ntrack of transactions. Its property of being tamper-proof let everybody\nknow the exact balance of an account by knowing its history of\ntransaction.\n\nIn a blockchain, each node of the network stores the full data.\nSo it is absolutely not the same idea as the DHT in which data\nare divided among nodes.  Every new entry in the blockchain must\nbe validated by a process called mining whose details are out of the scope of this answer but this process insure consensus of the\ndata.\n\nThe two structures are both distributed data structure but serve\ndifferent purposes. DHT aims to provide an efficient (in term of\nlookup time and storage footprint) structure to divide data on a\nnetwork and blockchain aims to provide a tamper-proof data\nstructure.","4":null,"5":"IF you wanna format date and times, probably the best light-weight library that you can find out there is moment.js\n\nvar parsed = moment.unix(1331300839)\n\n\nNow to format this moment instance, just use the format that you want from this list: http:\/\/momentjs.com\/docs\/#\/displaying\/  or use the very simple yet powerful moment.toString() or moment.fromNow()\n\nparsed.toString()\n\/\/ \"Fri Mar 09 2012 14:47:19 GMT+0100\"\n\nparsed.fromNow()\n\/\/ \"2 years ago\"","6":"Do you mean something like this ??\n\nprint r.json()['address'],' has ', r.json()['n_tx'], 'transactions'","7":null,"8":"I just tested this, and it seems to work:\n\n<script src=\"\/\/cdnjs.cloudflare.com\/ajax\/libs\/jquery\/2.0.3\/jquery.min.js\"><\/script>\n\n<script>\n\n$(document).ready\n(\n    function(){\n\n        initWebSocket();\n    }\n);\n<\/script>\n\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\nfunction initWebSocket()\n{\n    \/\/  init blockchain websocket (activity, blocks)\n    var blockchain = new WebSocket('ws:\/\/ws.blockchain.info:8335\/inv');\n\n    blockchain.onerror = function (error){ console.log('connection.onerror',error);
