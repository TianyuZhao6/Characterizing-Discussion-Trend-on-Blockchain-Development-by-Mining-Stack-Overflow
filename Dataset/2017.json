follows\nHelloWorld.sol:\n\npragma solidity ^0.4.17;\n\ncontract HelloWorld{  \n    function sayHello() internal pure returns(string){\n        return(\"Hello 2018!\");\n    }\n}\n\n\nInitial migrations.js:\n\nvar Migrations = artifacts.require(\".\/Migrations.sol\");\nvar HelloWorld = artifacts.require(\".\/HelloWorld.sol\");\n\nmodule.exports = function(deployer) {\n  deployer.deploy(Migrations);\n  deployer.deploy(HelloWorld);\n};\n\n\nAnd finally since im using truffle, truffle.js:\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  networks: {\n    development: {\n      host: \"localhost\",\n      port: 8545,\n      network_id: \"*\" \/\/ Match any network id\n    }\n  }\n\n};\n\n\nWhen I run commands:\n\ntruffle compile\ntruffle migrate\n\n\nThen go to console:\n\n   truffle console\n\n\nand i use js:\n\nvar hw\nHelloWorld.deployed().then(function(deployed){hw=deployed;});\n\n\nI get \n\n\n  Error: HelloWorld has not been deployed to detected network\n

(internal\/process\/next_tick.js:228:7)\n\n\nHow do i correctly deploy my contract and test its method?\n\nI should also add that my testrpc server is running at 8545 and everything seems to be alright. (all of this is running on localhost)\nI have tried to specify id of the network, i explicitly set id and specified in truffle.js, still not working.

It seems the NP-hard verification step can be resolved if you allow for multiple parallel blockchains with different sets of blocks in the head of each version. This of course creates another problem of trying to reconcile multiple blockchains in a secure manner.\n\nThe go-to proof-of-work method of reconciliation seems to be \"take whichever chain has the most work in it,\" but is there anything out there already which allows for the reconciliation of the blocks without a loss of proof or transactional data?","42":"I am trying to understand what I would need to develop a program similar to CryptoKitties.

I'm wondering how that matching would be implemented (either in the example app or in an actual implementation).\n\nExample of the app can be seen here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=suE5KHkESF4\n\nHow does \"Coffee with Blockchain\" match growers to buyers?\n\nSome questions to help guide the answer:\n\nDoes that matching operate entirely as chaincode? If so, how would that be implemented?\n\nEg, would the Grower submit a transaction that they have a new batch of beans ready for shipment and that triggers the match-making part in the chaincode to find\/choose a Buyer?\n\nI have my doubts on making that process deterministic, otherwise a grower's new batch announcement fails and they'd have to retry. Perhaps there's a different way of doing so in chaincode?\n\nOr does the matching operate outside of the chaincode, listening for updates in the ledger, and instead it calls the API to invoke a chaincode method to transfer the beans from Grower-A to Buyer-B?\n\nMy doubt on that though is the matching is then centralized to some trusted provider, rather than validated\/endorsed chaincode.\n\nThanks","46":"I was following this tutorial of building a simple chaincode in dev mode here. \nI'm stuck here\nFirst I cleared everything with docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq). \nWhen I enter docker-compose -f docker-compose-simple.yaml up it ends with this Error: Error getting broadcast client: Error connecting to orderer:7050 due to context deadline exceeded\ncli          | Usage:\ncli          |   peer channel create [flags]\ncli          | \norderer      | 2017-12-05 20:44:53.681 UTC [orderer\/common\/deliver] Handle -> WARN 0d1 Error reading from stream: rpc error: code = Canceled desc = context canceled\norderer      | 2017-12-05 20:44:53.681 UTC [orderer\/main] func1 -> DEBU 0d2 Closing Deliver stream\ncli exited with code 1\n\nWhat is causing problem?

To avoid disclosing the business idea, I'll have to be abstract here and use an analogy from healthcare industry, which has very similar specifics. Disclaimer: I'm very new to blockchains, so feel free to correct me.\n\nLet's imagine, there exists a drug to treat some specific kind of seizures that might occur for some people. \n\nThis drug can be prescribed only by certified companies. \n\nThe customer must receive only one dosage of the drug each time he\/she has a seizure. \n\nLet's assume that the distribution of the drug is perfect and there are no ways to steal the drug or illegally buy it.\n\nThe main problem to solve for the industry is to make sure that a person does not abuse the system and receives only one prescription for one event of seizure. Here is how a customer currently can cheat:\n\n\na customer has a seizure, goes to the local branch office of the imaginary company and asks for a prescription. The company does some medical tests and issues the prescription, keeping the record in the local database\nthe customer quickly travels to another company (maybe in another country) and again asks for a prescription. This company has no access to the data of the other companies and cannot find out if the customer has or has not already received a prescription elsewhere for this event of seizure. So, this company issues a new prescription again. \n\n\nNow the customer has received two prescriptions for a single event of seizure. That's abuse of the system.\n\nPrivate blockchains might solve the issue. But I have some doubts here:\n\n\nI'm not sure how new customer registration could be synchronized across the companies. If a record for this customer already exists in the distributed database, the operator should not create a new record. I doubt that a single block per customer would work because of the following points below. Do we need a blockchain of blockchains - that is, a master blockchain that gets updated with blocks to point to a new customer specific private blockchain each time a new customer joins our \"drug prescription system\"?\nWe want to keep entire history of the customer's seizures and received prescriptions. We never change existing records - they should be immutable. We just add new records to the customer's private \"history chain\". If we for some reason (error in medical tests etc.) want to cancel a previously issued prescription, we create a new record with information about the cancellation and the seizure timestamp for which the prescription has been cancelled.\nGiven access to customer's data, we want to be able to decode it all at once and then browse the records, filter them by date etc. But we might want to also collect some statistical data about all customers and their prescriptions. How do we implement searching, calculating etc. on a blockchain, if each customer's data has to be decrypted with a separate key? I guess, blockchains cannot be searched and filtered the same way as good old relational SQL databases, right? Does that mean we need some other parallel blockchain where we record and sync all the statistical data of interest? How to ensure transactions over multiple blockchains?\nAs I understand, usually block changes are possible only with private keys. But here we have two kinds of access requirements: \n\n\na customer should be able to read his own records only but does not have permissions to write any changes (no prescribing drugs to himself). So, he needs some kind of read-only-access key. \nthe company (and all of its local branches and partners in different countries) need to have read-add (not write - no actual modification of history) access for this customer. A customer cannot register himself but has to do it through the company. The company is the issuer of the keys and the holder of the \"add records key\". \n\n\n\nHow to ensure that these keys are distributed through the network of the companies and do not leak outside? Of course, we can give the \"public key\" to the customer so he\/she can read own records, but even this key is not entirely \"public\" per se - a customer should not access other customers' records.\n\n\nHow fast is blockchain distribution and how to resolve conflicts? If user has enough time to request two prescriptions in different companies, let's say, in 1 minute time, how do we ensure that only the first request is passed through and the second one gets rejected?\nWe want to record events in two sequences \n\n\nfor each customer separately - his private history, accessible only to himself and companies\nhistory of all prescriptions issued by the companies in our network\n\n\n\nDoes this again mean that we need two blockchains or is it possible to somehow create a single chain where all history records of the entire network are stored but every customer can access and decrypt only the records of his own history?\n\n\nWhich of the most popular enterprise level blockchain services and products (if any at all) might be the most appropriate for this case - Hyperledger, IBM Bluemix, Microsoft Coco, Etherium, Rubix by Deloitte?\nAnd finally, it seems all the problem boils down to the need of a central authority that would keep the registry of all prescriptions and customers. These companies are competitors and none of them wants to maintain the central database nor involve some neutral 3rd party company and pay for its services. Still, it's not clear if the blockchain (or maybe it would be more correct to call it just distributed ledger) will be the right solution because someone still has to establish and maintain the list of trusted companies. They definitely won't agree to use proof-of-work (mining) to ensure blockchain integrity, so again a central authority will be required anyway. But maybe I'm wrong.","124":"In acl file I have seen resource definition in following three syntaxes\n\n\norg.hyperledger.composer.system.*\norg.hyperledger.composer.system.**\n** \n\n\nwhat is the difference between these three and if there are any other possible definitions please do explain those thanks.","125":"I don't see a definition of the terms Validating Peer and Non-Validating Peer in the Glossary. It is important to have this definition as a good deal of literature seems to depend on these types of peers.\n\nComing to my main question.\n\nLooking at the Blockchain as a data-store, it is clear that, this datastore will expose functions to change and read the state of its store. Therefore, is the validating peer an entity that will verify the fact that, X was before state, T was the transaction applied and X' the resulting state?\n\nOr, will the validating peer also verify the business logic that T represents and the access level that should exist to invoke T?\n\nA centralized analogy is an RDBMS that uses a SQL engine to expose the state of store. This store can be updated via a combination of business logic (e.g. a rules engine) and SQL commands (e.g. INSERT, SELECT, etc.) My question is, is a validator interested in ensuring the SQL command worked successfully? Or, does it extend the validation to the rules engine also?","126":"I am a newbie and am learning about the blockchain and smart contracts.\n\nSo my question is can we add changes(features) to the smart contract code once it has been deployed?\n\nand is it possible to create an ERC 20 token that is based on proof of stake?\nThanks","127":"I created a contract token using the sample solidity code tutorial.

Since the Exodus wallet uses a standard twelve word mnemonic I fired it up and generated my wallet using the same mnemonic. However none of the keys match up! I exported my public key and made sure it was the same path of \"m\/0\/0\" from the master.

If I say, I don't want to transfer the rest of my 9 Bitcoins to the new Address? They should just stay in the original Wallet1?\n\nThe .fee(5430) means that I will spend 5430 Satoshi = USD $0.2337424950 for this Transaction?\n\nThe privkeySet in the .sign(privkeySet) function is the PrivateKey1 from my original Wallet1 right?

Both Deloitte and EY mention them.\n\nI somehow cannot understand how this could be of benefit for audits and\/or accounting. \n\n\nTo my understanding to make use of the power of blockchains you need multiple users. Only one user means you cannot validate the integrity since all blocks of that user could be compromised (if one block of a blockchain of a user got changed maybe also all of the following where changed, making it impossible to detect the modification). This means blockchains only make sense if you can share them with different users?\nData and thus blockchains however aren't always shared between multiple users. In accounting you often only have one \"user\"\/\"owner\" of the data. Sure you could create multiple users in one company but there wouldn't be any benefit since they are in one location (company) and potentially all compromised. Or if the admin want's to change something he could easily modify all users making it useless for audits.\nTo make it work you would need different partners (supplier\/customer) to share the information with. In that case you could however only have two users share the same blockchain (depending on legal regulations in your country) and then again who do you trust if one of the two doesn't validate?\nDeloitt mentions that they can be used for files. Again I don't see the benefit since you would need multiple users AND files might get compressed with a different algorithm over time rendering them invalid (the useful information didn't change but the block will still be invalid). Or is this a not an issue from your experience? To me it seems it could be a problem.\nThe same goes for all the internal data which may be important for audits from my point of view. Which company would like to share the information with independent users. Or is it only intendet for \"public\"\/\"shared\" data? \nTo identify a modification of one block in a blockchain the user would have ot validate every single block (every hash in the header of a block needs to be compared to the data of the previous block). In terms of accounting a blockchain could be all transactions of one account during one fiscal year. This however could easily be thousands of transactions. Wouldn't this be very slow to validate?\n\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the point in terms of audit trails but as long as the users are not independent data can always be modified making it useless for audits. And you need a critical mass to share the blockchain with.","263":"I am trying to write a program which is able to periodically upload data to a blockchain, for example the temperature in my office.

But using stub.getState(key), I can fetch only the latest entry of the key, but how can I fetch and display the series of changes\/modification written for the same key.\nI have iterated through the block using {peeraddress}\/Block\/getBlock\/{Block}, but I am getting the encrypted transaction payloads only since its security is on. I am not getting the idea to display the history of asset modifications for the same key.\n\nPlease suggest me the correct way to do this.\nThanks in advance","266":"I have freshly installed Docker community edition on windows because i need to run a hyperledger blockchain locally on my machine. However even though it was freshly installed the docker-compose version 1.14. I need to have docker-compose 1.8 to run the hyperledger blockchain according the documentation i got from the hyperledger getting started guide. I searched for ways to update the docker-compose version on windows to docker-compose version 1.8, but i haven't found a solid way to do that. Can someone enlighten me on how to do that?","267":"I'm modifying go-ethereum to be able to handle merged mining with a token we're creating. So every time a miner has our version of geth running and mining, if they find a block, they will receive X amount of our token via our contract. \n\nThe contract is built to handle giving out the reward to the miner of the block. I just need to modify go-ethereum to handle adding the transaction of calling the reward function in the contract and adding it to the tx pool before submitting the block.\n\nIn go-ethereum, I've added a new go file, token_claim.go in the miner package. Looking in miner.go file, it appears that I need to add in this code to build an sign the reward claim transaction in \/go-ethereum-1.6.7\/miner\/worker.go around line 474 right before sealing the block.\n\nCan someone provide an example of building a raw transaction in Go calling a contract function.

I am finding it hard to comprehend what this means. It would be great if someone could help understand this with an example.\n\n\nValue Blindness:\n\n\n\n  There is no way for a UTXO script to provide\n  fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn. For\n  example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a\n  hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30\n  days the script sends $1,000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This\n  would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD[Note\n  3], but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and\n  infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that\n  are available now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only\n  way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having\n  many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2k for every k up\n  to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.\n\n\n\nBlockchain-blindness\n\n\n\n  UTXO are blind to certain blockchain data such as the nonce and\n  previous block hash. This severely limits applications in gambling,\n  and several other categories, by depriving the scripting language of a\n  potentially valuable source of randomness.","277":"As the title states, basically my question is about the blockchain verification.

So my questions is whats is happening in a situation if Adam will find a block |5| first. Will Bob get his reward for finding a block? Or it means if Adam found one block, he has to find the next one which is extremely difficult without a huge network of computational resources in order to verify his previous block |4| and get reward for block 4 of 12.5 bitcoins, because the nodes will only accept the longest blockchain? I hope I clearly illustrated the picture. I've tried to find the answer in different videos and materials but somehow this aspect was put aside. If my assumption is true, it means there is no way how can a single person to earn anything from mining without a huge network ?","278":"Assuming you had 80 bytes of data and only the last 4 bytes was constantly changing, how would you efficiently hash the total 80 bytes using Go.

This technology have a lot of very interesting aspects I am interested to understand. \n\nTo make it short, a Blockchain represents a distributed and decentralized database deployed on a peer-to-peer network. Nodes are equally privileged, and equipotent participants: for each of them a full replica of the dataset is made available. This design assure a very high degree of fault tolerance (Byzantine) and can enable data integrity through proper cryptography and a consensus algorithm.\n\nI was now looking at a chainbase implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain framework implementation hosted by The Linux Foundation.\nIn particular, I came through an amazing sample project called Hyperledger Fabric Basics published by Anna D Derbakova and available on GitHub at: https:\/\/github.com\/angrbrd\/hyperledger-fabric-basics.\nIn this implementation, the author defined a network made of:\n\n\n4 peers;\n1 master service node CA.\n\n\n                                                  \n\nPlease, correct me if I am wrong, but does the master service node represent a single point of failure for the whole implementation? Indeed, the blockchain will be shared between the peers. However without a CA, it should not be possible anymore issuing signing keys for new transactions.\nIf true, which approaches are typically used to achieve a more robust design for a blockchain implementation?","284":"I have created a Blockchain service in my IBM-Bluemix account and deployed my chaincode successfully.\nAs a test, my chaincode simply creating and fetching the Assets using stub.PutState and stub.getState. \nBut while checking the Blockchain tab in dashboard, I can see, for each transaction it is creating a separate block for deploy and invoke operations as below.\n\n\n\nWhy it is not adding multiple transactions into same block and when it is considering transactions into a single block?\nHow these blocks from 4 to 6 coming which does not have any contents? is it coming because of any errors?\n\nI have gone through the Bluemix Doc, but didn't get a clear idea about this. \nThanks in advance.","285":"What happens in Hyperledger Fabric on a private channel block-chain consisting of only two peers if one of the peers is faulty and manipulates it's private block chain?\n\nSo the two copies of the block chain will diverge and finally it will be impossible for a consensus algorithm to tell which one is correct.\n\nIs this a valid problem?

I can find the ether successully transferred, and record can been found in the block.\n\nIf a transaction is delivered on Node 2, all good, no problem. Transaction record can been found in the block and I am able call Instance.paper() to obtain the return values stored on the chain.\n\nIf a transaction is delivered on Node 1 or Node 3 (Not the node running the smart contract), wrong things happen. Check the blocks infomation by eth.getTransactionReceipt, eth.getTransaction, eth.getBlock, we could find the parameters have been successfully put on the chain, which means this specific transaction should have succeeded. And of course, I check this by txpool.status and eth.getBlockTransactionCount(\"pending\"), and there would be zero on each node. However, if I try to call a public function Instance.papers() in order for the return values, it shows \" Error: new BigNumber() not a base 16 number:\", which means the contract status has not been yet changed. I DONT'T think it is because of the non-synced chain issue across these three nodes since the transactionHash and transactionContent can be found inside the block and eth.blockNumber are exactly the same. \n\nOf course I can be clearly base the fact that data has been successfully uploaded on chain on the existence of transaction record inside the block, but this is very weird for me, and I wish to call the public function directly to look up the data I put in my private chain.

However I have no idea how you could actually implement this in the contract and if it is possible. I am using Truffle, TestRPC and Solidity for writing the contract, and calling the functions from the truffle terminal. The contracts look like these (showing just the bare minimum functions):\n\nMain Contract:\n\n\/\/ One (main) contract to control them all\nimport 'Company.sol';\n\ncontract Creator {\n\n    string[] public names;\n    address[] public companies;\n\n    \/\/ Creates a company\n    function createCompany(string _companyName, uint _noOfShares, uint _pricePerShare, address _creator) returns(address) {\n        address newCompany = new Company(_companyName, _noOfShares, _pricePerShare, _creator);\n        names.push(_companyName);\n        companies.push(newCompany);\n        return newCompany;\n    }\n\n    \/\/ Returns the name of a company given an index\n    function getName(uint i) constant returns(string companyName) {\n        return names[i];\n    }\n    \/\/ Returns the address of a company given an index\n    function getAddress(uint i) constant returns(address companyAddress) {\n        return companies[i];\n    }\n\n    \/\/ Returns the address of the last company created\n    function getLastAddress() constant returns(address companyAddress) {\n        return companies[companies.length - 1];\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nCompany Contract\n\nimport 'Shareholder.sol';\n\ncontract Company {\n\n  mapping(address => address) public shareholders; \/\/Mapping from user \n  account address to shareholder contract address\n\n  function getShareNo(address _user) constant returns (uint _amount){\n    \/\/ Get the shareholder contract address for the user\n    address sellerContractAddr = getShareholder(_user);\n    Shareholder sellerContract = Shareholder(sellerContractAddr);\n\n    uint shares = sellerContract.getShareBalance();\n\n    return shares;\n  }\n\n    function getShareholder(address _user) constant returns (address shareholder){\n        return shareholders[_user];\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nShareholder Contract:\n\ncontract Shareholder {\n\n   uint public shareBalance; \n\n    \/\/ Function to return the share balance\n    function getShareBalance() constant returns (uint balance){\n      return shareBalance;\n    }\n}\n\n\nEDIT:\nAfter Rob's response and more testing, I realize this does not have anything to do with promises but with the instantiation of the Company contract by the Creator contract. When deployed directly from truffle, the functions of Company.sol work, but when deployed from Creator only certain ones work, excluding the ones I mentioned.

And my question is regarding destroying coins in a smart contract.\n\nAll of the current implementations similar to my project don't have a proper protocol for destroying coins that would aim to prevent hyper deflation in its value. Some projects destroy their proposed energy currency through transaction costs and lost wallets but I don't think that's enough. This is because energy coins can be minted at an exponential rate if more and more people begin to adopt the project and use their solar panels and wind farms to mint big amounts of coins. And coins would stay in circulation that represent energy generated (and used) days\/weeks\/months ago in the past.  \n\nI want to propose that you can use these coins to pay the utilities for energy consumption, and this will ultimately destroy those exact coins, which is written in the immutable smart contract that the consumer and energy company will agree upon.  \n\nI'm new to computer coding and I don't want to assume one can easily write in a smart contract to say destroy() the specified number of coins. Would it be possible for one to do this and make it work?

Typical xpub path would be m\/44'\/0'\/0', where as a typical address path would look like m\/44'\/0'\/0'\/0\/0 .  And xpub creates the full address as something like xpub\/0\/0 .

Technically speaking, there's nothing preventing you from using a hybrid solution with a blockchain and a more traditional backend persistence layer. Supporters would agree with you that it is costly and takes more time to execute methods, so a hybrid solution makes sense.

Gas is just a measurement of how expensive operations are when executing contract code. Each operation has a fixed amount of gas consumed. You can change the amount of ether you're willing to pay for the gas consumed which will affect how quickly the transaction is mined.  cost = gas * gasPrice  See docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 for gas consumed for different operations.

Basically, the way endorsement works is that endorsing nodes simulate a chaincode transaction, capture the read and write sets for the transaction and sign the result. There isn't any provision for a user \"approving\" as a function of the chaincode execution.   The closest thing we have for that would be the process for collecting signatures on a transaction to modify the channel block to upgrade the chaincode or add new member(s).\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0christo4ferris\n                \n                Oct 20, 2017 at 17:00\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Ok can you elaborate process of collecting the signatures on a transaction?

It's rarely as simple as \"change a few lines to sprinkle some blockchain in.\" (dare I say: never?) Storage and computation is many orders of magnitude more expensive, so you'll want to think about what stays on your servers and what goes in the blockchain. In general, storing data is as simple as creating a smart contract with a variable, and setting the variable value by issuing a transaction.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0carver\n                \n                Oct 5, 2017 at 21:28\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","162":"Issue may be server sided as I am also unable to establish a connection (even when hitting their server directly with websocket.connect('wss:\/\/streamer.cryptocompare.com\/socket.io\/websocket')).\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0rob\n                \n                Oct 4, 2017 at 18:09\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Also worth noting, when using the JavaScript client it connects with no errors\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0rob\n                \n                Oct 4, 2017 at 18:11\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Yes, however I think our problem is lack of good example.

Just because two technologies are using Merkle trees prominently as part of their concept, that does not make them the same. It is incorrect to reduce either Git or block chains to just merkle trees as neither of them are merkle trees. They only use them. That makes the linked post completely irrelevant since it is actually talking about merkle trees, and not block chains.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0poke\n                \n                Feb 22, 2018 at 9:26\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    2\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Can you cite the statement: \"git is not considered a block chain\"?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Jannis Ioannou\n                \n                May 18, 2018 at 8:00\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    \n                \u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\n            Show 7 more comments","200":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","201":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","202":"FYI, there are many more ethereum-specific tags over at ethereum.stackexchange.com .\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0carver\n                \n                Sep 12, 2017 at 12:45\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","203":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","204":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","205":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","206":"1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Can you add some links for people that haven't heard of Hyperledger and are curious?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Peter Cordes\n                \n                Sep 11, 2017 at 21:34\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Sure. hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Nathan Aw\n                \n                Sep 12, 2017 at 17:11\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                wiki.hyperledger.org\/groups\/requirements\/use-case-inventory\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Nathan Aw\n                \n                Sep 12, 2017 at 17:28\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                intelledger.github.io\/contents.html\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Haim Cohen\n                \n                Sep 12, 2017 at 17:33\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @HaimCohen and Nathan: I added links to the actual question.

A prior 'composer runtime install' had already been done, on those peers. The 'start' only needs to be done once for the business network (eg, by Org1 admin in this case).  So the connection profile will contain the peer node info, that belongs to both Org1 and Org2 (ie a component part of the 'PeerAdmin@byfn-network-org1' card imported in the wallet).

Thus, if you want to do a payment on a mobile device, for example, your mobile device will need some other way to verify the number of coins in your account and others' accounts because it can't download the entire Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTo my understanding, there are nodes that do store the entire blockchain and you can simply ask those nodes that you trust for the current number of coins in certain accounts. There is an element of trust here, but if you don't trust anyone, then you need to download the entire blockchain yourself.","61":"You can try this:\n\nfirst thing, you have to make sure that the blockchain wallet services are running on your server on port 3000.

Since Bitcoin's 10-minute blocks hold a finite number of transactions, you might need to wait longer than that if your transaction wasn't included in the upcoming block.\n\nOn top of that, once your transaction is on the blockchain, you should ideally wait until several more blocks are mined until you're confident that your transaction got included in the globally-accepted branch (the longest branch).\n\nSo, to be safe, if you decide to wait for 6 blocks after your transaction is included, you'd end up waiting an additional hour until you're relatively confident that your transaction has been accepted.\n\n\n  If yes, how can I handle the real-time system requirement in the\n  blockchain?\n\n\nThat's one challenge that Bitcoin hasn't overcome yet. The closest work-in-progress solution is the Lightning Network, but that's still in development.\n\nIn the meantime, some applications might decide to process real-time transactions off-chain by accepting transactions before they're included in the blockchain. But this is a risky trade-off; you'd allow fast transactions at the cost of security, opening yourself up to double-spending.","63":"You can't claim BCH without knowing private key, even if you withdraw that Bitcoin to your BTC wallet.

The network will handle it, and the only way you can manage datas is by having more than 50% of the mining power (in an other way the network let users manage datas in an normal use case, for exemple, send your bitcoin is a normal use case, steal someone is not)\nSorry, I never heard about it =\/\n\n\nTo others: Feel free to modify my answer as you please, I'm not an expert, just trying to share and perfect my knowledge","75":"To my knowledge this cannot be done yet. The only progress made regarding ZK in Ethereum is verifying a transaction made on the Zcash blockchain. In other words yes you need to wait for a full implementation.","76":null,"77":"Interesting question. I would say the blockchain technology solves only probabilistic consensus. With a certain confidence, the blockchain-network agrees on something.\n\nViewing blockchain as a distributed system we can say that the state of blockchain is distributed: the blockchain is kept as a whole but there are many distributed replicas of local copies. More interestingly, the operations are distributed: Writes or reads can happen at different nodes concurrently. Read operations can be done locally at the local copy of the blockchain, but this read can of course be stale if your local copy is not up-to-date, however there is always an incentive for nodes in the blockchain network to keep their local copy up-to-date so that they can complete new transactions when necessary.\n\nWrite operations is the tricky part here, that blockchain must solve. As writes happen concurrently in a distributed fashion, blockchain must ensure to avoid inconsistencies such as double spending and somehow reach consensus on the current state. The way blockchain does this is probabilistic, first of all they made it expensive to write to the chain by adding the \"puzzle\" to be solved, reducing the probability that different distributed writes happen concurrently, but they can still happen, but with lower probability. In addition, as there is an incentive for nodes in the network to keep their state up to date, nodes that received the flooded write operation will validate it and accept that operation into their chain. I think the incentive to always keep the chain up-to-date is key here because that ensures that the chain will make progress. I.e a writer has a clear incentive to keep its chain up-to-date since it will be competing with the \"longest-chain-first\" principle against other concurrent writers. For non-adversarial miners there is also an incentive to interrupt the current mining, accept a new write-block and restart the mining process, ensuring a sort of liveness in the system.\n\nSo blockchain relies on probabilistic consensus, what is the probability then? The probability that two exactly equal branches growing in parallel at the same time is close to 0 assuming that there are not any large group of adversarial nodes taking over the network. With very high probability  one branch will be longer than the other and be accepted and the network reach consensus on that branch and write operations in the shorter branch have to be re-tried. The big concern is of course big adversarial miner groups who might deliberately try to create forks in the blockchain to perform double spending attacks.. but that is only likely to succeed if they get close to 50% of the computational power in the network.\n\nSo to conclude: natural branching in blockchain that can happen due to probabilistic reasons of concurrent writes (probability reduced due to the puzzle-solving) will with almost 100% probability converge to a single branch as write operations continue to happen, and the network reaches consensus on a single branch.\n\n\n  However, this seems like a slow and least-deliberate method. It\n  ensures that there is a certain amount of wasted work on the part of\n  nodes that happen to be in a part of the network that had a local\n  valid solution at roughly the same time as a generally accepted\n  solution.\n  \n  Are there better alternatives?\n\n\nNot that I can think of, there would be many more efficient solutions if all peers in the system \"were under control\" and you could make them follow some protocol and perhaps have a designated leader to tell the order of writes and ensure consensus, but that is not possible in a decentralized open system.","78":"the pre-requisites section defines what's require to INSTALL Composer modules.

Upon delivery of P by A to B, there will be method(verify) that B and A can verify(using some protocol where 2 parties agree upon a decision and only when both say yes it is true or false) that a certain condition is met i.e. either C1 or C2.\nWhen that condition is met that payment is done (either $x or $y)  \n\n\nIf upon delivery of P from A to B both will try to invoke the method verify and agree upon the condition.

Like i said before these invocations are transactions which are stored on the blockchain. These transactions will have information about which method was invoked with what arguements and the timestamp.\nThese transactions will be present with other transactions on that particular block which is mined.\nWhen defining your conditions in a method. You will have conditions on who can call those methods. The miner will only run the code irrespective if the code returns an error or not. So if verify method is invoked by someone who is not suppose to, your code should return an error(this is your responsibility on how you code your smart contract).

Sawtooth has a flexible approach using roles and permissions.\nHyperledger Fabric supports only permissioned blockchain networks.  Fabric has a prescriptive\/well-defined approach through pluggable membership service providers (MSPs) that enables a tighter governance framework.\n\nConsensus algorithms\n\n\nSawtooth uses Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) based on Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to elect leaders to cut blocks based on random wait times, a more energy efficient approach than the traditional Proof of Work, which enables scaling to very large networks.\nFabric supports pluggable consensus algorithms to order transactions into blocks, with Kafka support available since version v1.0, and Raft and BFT implementations in development.\n\nSmart contract language\n\n\nHyperledger Sawtooth supports Go, JavaScript, Java, Python, Rust, and Ethereum Solidity based contracts.\nHyperledger Fabric supports Go, JavaScript, Java, and Ethereum Solidity based contracts.\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nIn Hyperledger Sawtooth, peers have access to all transaction data.\nIn Hyperledger Fabric, there are multiple levels of privacy. You can define \u00e2\u0080\u0098channels' for complete data isolation between a set of participants, where each channel is essentially its own private blockchain. Or you can use 'private data collections\u00e2\u0080\u0099 when participants need to transact on the same blockchain, but keep data private to a subset of transactors (and potentially regulators\/auditors). Private data is shared peer-to-peer, with hashes stored on the blockchain as evidence so that all peers can validate transactions.  Additionally, you can utilize Identity Mixer to preserve anonymity of transaction submitters.\n\nTransaction flow\n\n\nHyperledger Sawtooth supports the traditional blockchain flow of Order-Execute-Commit.\nHyperledger Fabric supports a unique endorsement model where transactions are initially executed on a set of peers and follows a Execute-Order-Commit model. The set of required endorsers can be defined at the contract level or at the data level. This approach improves scalability, prevents nondeterminism in contract code, and enables transactions to be executed in private between a set of transactors as mentioned above.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\nHyperledger Sawtooth supports transaction batches as a unit of work i.e. either all the transactions in a batch are committed or none of them is committed.\nHyperledger Sawtooth includes a (generic) REST API server\nHyperledger Fabric supports queries from smart contract chaincode, either using key range queries or JSON queries (when using CouchDB as a state database)","122":"I have several related comments:\n\n1) The page you linked to shows an early version of the IoT Contract Platform that I authored.

So what you need to do is to:\n\n\nDefine\/decide where you would like to run ordering service which will take care of transactions order.\nDefine a channel with two organizations\nIn configtx.yaml you need to specify the address of the ordering service.\nCreate a channel to generate genesis block\nJoin all peers for both organization using the genesis block\n\n\nNow since ordering service endpoint is endcoded in configuration transaction each organization will elect one peer to open connection to the ordering service to pull new blocks. Finally this leader will distribute blocks inside its own organization.\n\nJust to summarize, to make two \"instance\" (here I assume independent set of peers) connected you need to make them connected to same channel moreover you need to make sure they will be connected to same ordering service.","173":"To create a new peer you simply need to generate proper crypto material for that peer signed by its organization. For that purpose you can use cryptogen cli tool, where you simply can reuse existing crypto-config.yaml file, where you need to define organization with template for number of peers and how many user certificates to generate:\n\nPeerOrgs:\n  - Name: Org1\n    Domain: org1.example.com\n    Template:\n      Count: 2\n    Users:\n      Count: 1\n  - Name: Org2\n    Domain: org2.example.com\n    Template:\n      Count: 2\n    Users:\n      Count: 1\n\n\nIn example above it define two orgs with two peers and one user per each org.\n\nNext you have to define a channel with configtxgen which specifies your requirements, for you case you would like to have:\n\n\n  2 peers and 2 channels, one peer for each channel. \n\n\nhence need to define profile which will specify those channels, now the question whenever those peers belongs to same organization or not. Assuming they from different organizations, therefore configuration will look like following:\n\nProfiles:\n\n    TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis:\n        Orderer:\n            <<: *OrdererDefaults\n            Organizations:\n                - *OrdererOrg\n        Consortiums:\n            SampleConsortium:\n                Organizations:\n                    - *Org1\n                    - *Org2\n    ChannelOne:\n        Consortium: SampleConsortium\n        Application:\n            <<: *ApplicationDefaults\n            Organizations:\n                - *Org1\n    ChannelTwo:\n        Consortium: SampleConsortium\n        Application:\n            <<: *ApplicationDefaults\n            Organizations:\n                - *Org2\n\n\nNow, you need to generate config transaction for both channels to generate genesis block and being able to join the channels. \n\nFABRIC_CFG_PATH=. configtxgen -profile ChannelOne -channelID channelone -outputCreateChannelTx=channelone.tx\n\nFABRIC_CFG_PATH=. configtxgen -profile ChannelTwo -channelID channeltwo -outputCreateChannelTx=channeltwo.tx\n\n\nFinally once you have config transactions for each channel you can submit them to the ordering service creating a new channel and later to join peers into appropriate channels. Please note that you do not really need to change crypto-config.yaml.","174":"Basically, mapping is equivalent to a dictionary or a map in other programming languages.

So if this was a map of addresses to integers then it would look something like:\n\n[0x000000000000000A] 555\n[0x0000000000000004] 123\n....\n[0x0000000000000006] 22\n[0x0000000000000003] 6\n\n\nOr in code\n\nmapping(address => uint) _map;\n\nfunction getter(address _addr) returns(uint) {\n    return _map[_addr];\n}\n\n\nSo basically, you're referencing values with an object instead of an integer in short.

So you have 4 persons: Alice, Bob, Charlie and John and business rule which says that once Alice submit an asset it has to be distributed according to 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% respectively.\n\nNext, to continue with say Alice works at Org1, Bob at Org2, Charlie at Org3 and John from Org4. Now you can implement a chaincode which will apply business rule based on whoever submits the transaction. Moreover you can implement ACL based on the submitter identity, hence to prevent from Bob query for balance of the let's say John. \n\nThe legitimate question will be why do I need 4 peers to implement such simple logic. As you can have only one peer with chaincode deployed, channel which configured for all 4 orgs and all you need is to send transactions proposal to invoke the chaincode. \n\nThe caveat in this approach is pretty obvious you need to decide which org will host and run this peer and the chaincode, therefore as all 4 orgs doesn't really trust each other they would like to host they own peer and invoke chaincode against theirs own peers. And in order to prevent each org to trick each other and reduce the influence of adversarial\/non-deterministic behavior they will agree on endorsement policies which actually will make sure that peers of other orgs also receives same results as you during the simulation.\n\nNow back to your question, peers are used to simulate transaction against current state and sign on the results, send results back to the client which aggregates endorsements based on policies and submits results to the ordering service which cuts blocks and deliver them to the peers, which will validate correctness of transactions in the block and eventually commit them to the ledger updating state.\n\nTherefore your chaincode should encode notion of clients\/users\/persons among which you will distribute assets, those users could be mapped back to the client application (real world users), which might be enrolled into different organizations, hence having different certificates signed by appropriate org CA. Finally you will be able to leverage GetCreator API of the chaincode to understand which client invoked the chaincode and apply business logic and access control based on business logic you defined. \n\nSorry for making my answer too long, but to summarize. Your application\/service will be based on two tiers: first one is the application tier - mapped to the user of org, second tier is the peer which holds the ledger and deployed chaincode - to simulate and execute transactions. Hence you will have 4 peers and 4 clients which will submit transaction to the peers and your logic will be based on the client identities rather on the peers.\n\nHope my explanation will make sense to you ;)","188":"Try:\n\n\"0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733c\", 1234, 1235\n\n\nIt's comma delimited\n\nEdit: I've just seen the comment above, there's also a modifier constraint called \"Crowdsale\" can you please provide the code for this too as this could be causing further errors.","189":null,"190":"TL;DR; This code simply defines the start and end of the ICO using block number, but it extends various other sources to implement the Token, etc. Modifying it won't cause any issues.\n\nI think you're starting in the wrong place. Firstly, you can add any code to any contract without implicating its existing functionality. I know it's a little premature, but I plan to do 2 tutorials in the next day or so on the ERC20 and ERC223 standards which is what a token should be designed around. This will be posted on https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCaWes1eWQ9TbzA695gl_PtA\n\nERC20\n\ncontract ERC20 {\n    function totalSupply() constant returns (uint totalSupply);\n    function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);\n    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);\n    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);\n    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining);\n    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);\n    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value);\n}\n\n\nERC223\n\ncontract ERC223 {\n    uint public totalSupply;\n    function balanceOf(address who) constant returns (uint);\n    function name() constant returns (string _name);\n    function symbol() constant returns (string _symbol);\n    function decimals() constant returns (uint8 _decimals);\n    function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 _supply);\n    function transfer(address to, uint value) returns (bool ok);\n    function transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data) returns (bool ok);\n    function transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data, string custom_fallback) returns (bool ok);\n    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value, bytes indexed data);\n}\n\n\nAfter you have your contract for your token you then want to think about the ICO. With the ICO you should define start and end points. In the example above this is based off the blocks which is why you have:\n\n  require(startingBlock > block.number && startingBlock < endsAt);\n\n\nand\n\n  require(endingBlock > block.number && endingBlock > startsAt);\n\n\nThis contract is inheriting from a contract called \"Crowdsale\" which is where most of your implementation looks like it's coming from. The full source code for this can be found on https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xb9aac097f4dadcd6f06761eb470346415ef28d5a#code This token is based around ERC20 standard and has quite a bit of an inheritance tree.\n\nThe code for the token is done in the BasicToken :\n\n\/**\n * @title Basic token\n * @dev Basic version of StandardToken, with no allowances. \n *\/\ncontract BasicToken is ERC20Basic {\n  using SafeMath for uint;\n\n  mapping(address => uint) balances;\n\n  \/**\n   * Obsolete.

Most of the research is geared towards dealing with keeping the data off the chain.

You should (as per the Developer Tutorial) paste the Unit test script into the file located at test\/sample.js.  I think perhaps the fact that the filenames (in both 'lib' and 'test' subdirectories) are the same, has caused some confusion - think I will get that changed to improve user experience.  The other Angular error (mentioned earlier) still stands.\n\nOn your second posting (Angular module errors). A local Composer playground install has dependencies on Angular (note the Developer guide uses the online playground). Check out package.json for that list of angular dependencies. Doesn't look like your playground installed correctly, if its showing missing dependencies (@angular\/core etc) Suggest to clear down docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm -f and docker images -aq | xargs docker rmi -f (warning: clears down all docker containers in your dev environment) then install it (as a non-privileged user) using the one-liner - ie npm uninstall -g composer-playground - installs playground in a docker container using the command  curl -sSL https:\/\/hyperledger.github.io\/composer\/install-hlfv1.sh | bash .","193":"To find the most appropriate times to use a blockchain you should boil it down to what its core usefulness is, which is as an immutable, auditable, secure ledger that can be shared.  While it does provide other benefits, those can vary from chain to chain.  Those are important because those are things that don't typically exist in other formats. For example, typically it might not make sense to store data directly on a blockchain(this could vary and should be taken as a general statement) since a regular database could do it better; however, it might make sense to store Digital Rights on the blockchain and use the blockchain to securely transfer those rights, which are to offchain data like music, since individuals could buy and sell data right securely and trustlessly with no middle man.  It might also make sense to store computer code on the blockchain in which you could run a predictions market or a governance system that would be relatively fraud proof\n\nSome general good uses\/product I would look at are music and DRM related projects, filecoin and gnt are interesting, aragon which deals with governance, gnosis, and Brave\/BAT also has a decent use case.\n\nWhen evaluating a project, you should ask 'why cant I use a standard database for this? And If I can use one why is a blockchain better?' If you cant answer any of those questions, blockchain might not be the best choice.  If you can, I would take a look.  \n\nAs for starting a blockchain.  I would advise looking at smart contracts or Ethereum for the time being.  I would not try to start your own blockchain and would advice contributing to open source first\n\nLet me know if this helps or you need more.","194":"Try removing the invereted commas in the commands.\n\nDelete the server and client folder and follow the instructions from the blog avoiding the inverted commas.\n\n1.Initialize the server\n\nfabric-ca-server init -b admin:adminpw\n\n\n2.Start the server\n\nfabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw\n\n\n3.Enroll the Admin\n\nfabric-ca-client enroll -u http:\/\/admin:adminpw@localhost:7054\n\n\n4.Create new user and register it\n\nfabric-ca-client register -u http:\/\/localhost:7054 --id.name test --id.secret testpw --id.type client --id.affiliation org1.department1 \n\n\nHopefully you wont face the error you received!\n\nAssuming you have build fabric ca server and client successfully.","195":null,"196":"You've got a scoping issue in totalSupply.\n\n    function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 _totalSupply) {\n        return _totalSupply;\n    }\n\n\nBasically, in your returns you've defined _totalSupply as a local variable which is going to take precedence over the instance version of _totalSupply and the local value is never set so it will always return 0\n\nYou could change this to \n\n    function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256) {\n        return _totalSupply;\n    }\n\n\nor\n\n    function totalSupply() constant returns (uint256 _totalSupply) {\n        _totalSupply = __totalSupply;\n    }\n\n\nand change \n\nuint public _totalSupply = 10000000;\n\n\nto \n\nuint private __totalSupply = 10000000;\n\n\nThis is important to do anyway as if you set your total supply to public anyone can change its value.","197":"Please clarify the question.

A merkle tree is a tree where each node is labeled with the cryptographic hash value of their contents, which includes the labels of its children.\n\nGit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directed acyclic graph is exactly that, a merkle tree where each node (tag, commit, tree, or blob object) is labeled with the hash of its content and the label of its \u00e2\u0080\u009cchild\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Note that for commits, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cchild\u00e2\u0080\u009d term conflicts a bit with Git\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of parents: Parent commits are the children of commits, you just need to look at the graph as a tree that keeps growing by re-rooting it.\n\nBlockchains are very similar to this, since they also keep growing that way, and they are also using its merkle tree property to ensure data integrity. But usually, blockchains are understood as way more than just merkle trees which is where they are separating from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstupid content tracker\u00e2\u0080\u009d Git. For example, blockchains usually also means having a highly decentralized system on a block level (not all blocks need to be in the same place).\n\nUnderstanding blockchains is kind of difficult (personally, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still far away from understanding everything about it), but I consider understanding Git internals as a good way to understand merkle trees which definitely helps understanding a fundamental part about blockchains.","200":"From my experience no, the trick is that you have a unique contract address you can use.  So there can be an unlimited number of tokens with the same name, the trick is that they will each have their own address.  Also you will get more responses if you use https:\/\/ethereum.stackexchange.com\/","201":"I wish to enquire if there are maximum no. of participants, assets, transaction that hyperledger can support?\n\nOf course there will be limits. But they are, for practical purposes, high enough to allow serious work to be done. Participants can take several forms:\n\n\norganizations with a separate identity and potentially with their own CA, MSP, orders, endorsers, and committers in any combination\nroles in chaincodes \nidentities with a specific role in an organization\n\n\nThe most limited will be organizations and peers etc, but a consortium can still be big enough to accommodate more than a small number of these to my knowledge. Roles and identities are dependent on your needs and the design of your smart contracts. Unless you are stress testing, how many of each do you really need? (Identities will be of course be largest in number, but the system is designed with that in mind, again to my knowledge).\n\nSo my point here is that the limits should be adequate for most practical purposes.\n\nAlso, is there rollback (ACID compliant, example) if the submission of a transaction fails?\n\nThe whole point of a blockchain is to provide a transparent, distributed ledger with perfect consistency at all times. So the answer is yes.\n\nNote, though, that roll-back simply means that at transaction succeeds or fails and that all copies of the ledger will have the identical result. If the transaction fails, then none of its changes will appear in the ledger. \n\nTransaction failure modes:\n\n\nFail during endorsement happens when the chaincode chooses to fail the transaction for violation of business rules or for internal errors.\nFail during commit happens when two transactions execute in parallel (for practical purposes that is -- they could execute too close together and get the same effect) and (a) touch the same keys, and (b) end up in the same block. In this case, the endorsers happily create the read \/ write sets for both, but the committers find that the second transaction is reading an invalid version of a key that was updated by an earlier transaction in the same block. The read \/ write set is never applied, thus providing the roll-back.\n\n\nThe solution to consistent failures during commit is to add flow control into the application. You cannot solve that in the chaincode.","202":"You can get the latest block number over rpc by calling the 'eth_blockNumber' method.\n\nFrom the JSON RPC docs:\n\n\n  Returns the number of most recent block.\n\n\/\/ Request\ncurl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":83}'\n\n\/\/ Result\n{\n  \"id\":83,\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"result\": \"0x4b7\" \/\/ 1207\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other, higher level APIs that you might be interested in, like web3.js or web3.py.

Each block is related with the previous block, so your transaction is throughout all the blockchain.\n\n\n  And will my transaction details be the only details on that block, or\n  will that block contain every transaction that happened within that\n  time period ?\n\n\nIt dependes on the implementation of Blockchain.

So, they get the consensus about what they are going to do, i.e. all the members have to agree about the functions of their Blockchain.\n\nFor each Blockchain, you can have more than one contract. But I'm going to explain it more simply. The Smart Contract is the code that is installed on all the nodes of the Blockchain, and every request is executed against it. So, every node\/member must have the same.","204":"As I understood you are planning to use a blockchain as a database to keep the records regarding lands, vehicles, government services etc. to avoid making illegal changes by the government officials themselves or some other third party.\n\nTo get the advantage of having a distributed database, in an application like yours especially, the blockchain should be a public one. (Rather than few government institutes running full nodes ). In that case as per your need of only protecting records it might probably be a separate blockchain for the particular purpose. And probably there should be an advantage for the participants for them to participate in mining consuming their resources. I think then you have to come up with a economic model as well. (although if this is not the exact way you are gonna do there have to be reason for ppl to participate somehow)\n\nAnd regarding how secure the system will be; that depends on your model. If it's going to be a blockchain with few nodes or even let's say public with a large no of nodes and if it's still worth the money to spend on attacking the network and acquiring one or two lands there can be situations that the network may under go 51% attack or a selfish mining attack.\n\nSo what I can suggest is to study more on blockchain, consensus algorithms used, how existing blockchains achieve the data security etc. and think about a model (may be an economic model) that the miners get an advantage by running the node, and the cost to attack the system outweigh the advantages that can be gained by attacking etc.","205":"While key persisted into DB it is prefixed with name of the chaincode, in your example it's mycc and as a separator used []byte{0x00} value.

There is natural HA across the network, plus most organizations would typically host multiple peers for 'local' HA as well.  If a peer goes down you route traffic to your other peers.

For example P2PKH scripts look like this:\n\nOP_DUP OP_HASH160 <PubkeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\n\n\nThis checks that the pubkey on the stack matches the hash, and then checks that the signature and pubkey are valid for the transaction.\n\nABE stores the output scripts, but appears not to create an index for the addresses.

The predefine number or difficulty changes to maintain an average time of 10 minutes to create each block.\n\nHowever, other implementations of Blockchain use other algorithms. For example, Hyperledger Fabirc uses the PBFT wich achieves the consensus in 10 seconds, i.e. creates each block in 10 seconds.\n\nNubits, like other implementations of Blockchain, uses the Proof of Stake. Proof of stake is a different way to validate transactions based and achieve the distributed consensus.

The timestamp is the\n\/\/ timestamp provided by the client in the proposal header.\n\/\/ GetHistoryForKey requires peer configuration\n\/\/ core.ledger.history.enableHistoryDatabase to be true.\n\/\/ The query is NOT re-executed during validation phase, phantom reads are\n\/\/ not detected. That is, other committed transactions may have updated\n\/\/ the key concurrently, impacting the result set, and this would not be\n\/\/ detected at validation\/commit time. Applications susceptible to this\n\/\/ should therefore not use GetHistoryForKey as part of transactions that\n\/\/ update ledger, and should limit use to read-only chaincode operations.\n\n\nGetHistoryForKey(key string) (HistoryQueryIteratorInterface, error)\n\n\nIn case you'd like to inspect history of changes not in context of chaincode you can use QSCC (Query System Chaincode), which provide following capabilities:\n\n\/\/ These are function names from Invoke first parameter\nconst (\n    GetChainInfo       string = \"GetChainInfo\"\n    GetBlockByNumber   string = \"GetBlockByNumber\"\n    GetBlockByHash     string = \"GetBlockByHash\"\n    GetTransactionByID string = \"GetTransactionByID\"\n    GetBlockByTxID     string = \"GetBlockByTxID\"\n)","266":"You can use below command in elevated Powershell in Windows 10.\n\nrun the following command to download Docker Compose, replacing $dockerComposeVersion with the specific version of Compose you want to use:\n\nInvoke-WebRequest \"https:\/\/github.com\/docker\/compose\/releases\/download\/$dockerComposeVersion\/docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe\" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $Env:ProgramFiles\\docker\\docker-compose.exe\n\nFor Eg:\n\nFor example, to download Compose version 1.22.0, the command is:\n\nInvoke-WebRequest \"https:\/\/github.com\/docker\/compose\/releases\/download\/1.22.0\/docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe\" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $Env:ProgramFiles\\docker\\docker-compose.exe","267":"Here's a simple example of how you can interact with a smart contract in Go.

But if you're looking for a long-term, reliable, not-rate-limited solution; you should run your own bitcoin node. It, of course, depends on your project's requirements.\n\nFor a robust solution to the OP's question, I suggest the following:\n\n\nRun a pruned bitcoin node using bitcoind\nEnable the ZeroMQ interface of bitcoind with the configuration option zmqpubrawtx=tcp:\/\/127.0.0.1:3600.

Then bitcoinjs-lib is used to decode those raw transactions.\n\nvar bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');\nvar zmq = require('zeromq');\nvar sock = zmq.socket('sub');\nvar addr = 'tcp:\/\/127.0.0.1:3600';\nsock.connect(addr);\nsock.subscribe('rawtx');\nsock.on('message', function(topic, message) {\n    if (topic.toString() === 'rawtx') {\n        var rawTx = message.toString('hex');\n        var tx = bitcoin.Transaction.fromHex(rawTx);\n        var txid = tx.getId();\n        tx.ins = tx.ins.map(function(in) {\n            in.address = bitcoin.address.fromOutputScript(in.script, bitcoin.networks.bitcoin);\n            return in;\n        });\n        tx.outs = tx.outs.map(function(out) {\n            out.address = bitcoin.address.fromOutputScript(out.script, bitcoin.networks.bitcoin);\n            return out;\n        });\n        console.log('received transaction', txid, tx);\n    }\n});\n\n\nFor more details, please have a look at this guide","270":"I am not sure if that is what you need...

Therefore while implementting a flow on your chaincode you can use different response types to signal and forward the error back to the client side, for example:\n\nfunc (t *SimpleChaincode) Invoke(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) pb.Response {\n    fmt.Println(\"ex02 Invoke\")\n    function, args := stub.GetFunctionAndParameters()\n    if function == \"invoke\" {\n        \/\/ Make payment of X units from A to B\n        return t.invoke(stub, args)\n    } else if function == \"delete\" {\n        \/\/ Deletes an entity from its state\n        return t.delete(stub, args)\n    } else if function == \"query\" {\n        \/\/ the old \"Query\" is now implemtned in invoke\n        return t.query(stub, args)\n    }\n\n    return shim.Error(\"Invalid invoke function name. Expecting \\\"invoke\\\" \\\"delete\\\" \\\"query\\\"\")\n}\n\n\nWill respond with error if you will try to invoke chaincode with wrong parameters set.

After some time, one of the two branches will be longer, so you will delete the second one.\n\n\nThe miners of the Blockchain will create some blocks and a branch will be longer after some time.\n\n\nIn Blockchain, a block is considered well when it has 100 blocks (I d0n't know exactly how many) above of it. So, the reward is taken after 100 blocks, not before.","278":"You can try the following examples on the Go Playground. Benchmark results is at the end.\n\nNote: the implementations below are not safe for concurrent use; I intentionally made them like this to be simpler and faster.\n\nFastest when using only public API (always hashes all input)\n\nThe general concept and interface of Go's hash algorithms is the hash.Hash interface. This does not allow you to save the state of the hasher and to return or rewind to the saved state. So using the public hash APIs of the Go standard lib, you always have to calculate the hash from start.\n\nWhat the public API offers is to reuse an already constructed hasher to calculate the hash of a new input, using the Hash.Reset() method. This is nice so that no (memory) allocations will be needed to calculate multiple hash values. Also you may take advantage of the optional slice that may be passed to Hash.Sum() which is used to append the current hash to. This is nice so that no allocations will be needed to receive the hash results either.\n\nHere's an example that takes advantage of these:\n\ntype Cached1 struct {\n    hasher hash.Hash\n    result [sha256.Size]byte\n}\n\nfunc NewCached1() *Cached1 {\n    return &Cached1{hasher: sha256.New()}\n}\n\nfunc (c *Cached1) Sum(data []byte) []byte {\n    c.hasher.Reset()\n    c.hasher.Write(data)\n    return c.hasher.Sum(c.result[:0])\n}\n\n\nTest data\n\nWe'll use the following test data:\n\nvar fixed = bytes.Repeat([]byte{1}, 76)\nvar variantA = []byte{1, 1, 1, 1}\nvar variantB = []byte{2, 2, 2, 2}\n\nvar data = append(append([]byte{}, fixed...), variantA...)\nvar data2 = append(append([]byte{}, fixed...), variantB...)\n\nvar c1 = NewCached1()\n\n\nFirst let's get authentic results (to verify if our hasher works correctly):\n\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\\n\", sha256.Sum256(data))\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\\n\", sha256.Sum256(data2))\n\n\nOutput:\n\nfb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a\n10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c\n\n\nNow let's check our Cached1 hasher:\n\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\\n\", c1.Sum(data))\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\\n\", c1.Sum(data2))\n\n\nOutput is the same:\n\nfb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a\n10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c\n\n\nEven faster but may break (in future Go releases): hashes only the last 4 bytes\n\nNow let's see a less flexible solution which truly calculates the hash of the first 76 fixed part only once.\n\nThe hasher of the crypto\/sha256 package is the unexported sha256.digest type (more precisely a pointer to this type):\n\n\/\/ digest represents the partial evaluation of a checksum.\ntype digest struct {\n    h     [8]uint32\n    x     [chunk]byte\n    nx    int\n    len   uint64\n    is224 bool \/\/ mark if this digest is SHA-224\n}\n\n\nA value of the digest struct type basically holds the current state of the hasher.\n\nWhat we may do is feed the hasher the fixed, first 76 bytes, and then save this struct value. When we need to caclulate the hash of some 80 bytes data where the first 76 is the same, we use this saved value as a starting point, and then feed the varying last 4 bytes.\n\nNote that it's enough to simply save this struct value as it contains no pointers and no descriptor types like slices and maps. Else we would also have to make a copy of those, but we're \"lucky\". So this solution would need adjustment if a future implementation of crypto\/sha256 would add a pointer or slice field for example.\n\nSince sha256.digest is unexported, we can only use reflection (reflect package) to achieve our goals, which inherently will add some delays to computation.\n\nExample implementation that does this:\n\ntype Cached2 struct {\n    origv   reflect.Value\n    hasherv reflect.Value\n    hasher  hash.Hash\n\n    result [sha256.Size]byte\n}\n\nfunc NewCached2(fixed []byte) *Cached2 {\n    h := sha256.New()\n    h.Write(fixed)\n\n    c := &Cached2{origv: reflect.ValueOf(h).Elem()}\n    hasherv := reflect.New(c.origv.Type())\n    c.hasher = hasherv.Interface().(hash.Hash)\n    c.hasherv = hasherv.Elem()\n\n    return c\n}\n\nfunc (c *Cached2) Sum(data []byte) []byte {\n    \/\/ Set state of the fixed hash:\n    c.hasherv.Set(c.origv)\n\n    c.hasher.Write(data)\n    return c.hasher.Sum(c.result[:0])\n}\n\n\nTesting it:\n\nvar c2 = NewCached2(fixed)\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\\n\", c2.Sum(variantA))\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\\n\", c2.Sum(variantB))\n\n\nOutput is again the same:\n\nfb8e69bdfa2ad15be7cc8a346b74e773d059f96cfc92da89e631895422fe966a\n10ef52823dad5d1212e8ac83b54c001bfb9a03dc0c7c3c83246fb988aa788c0c\n\n\nSo it works.\n\nThe \"ultimate\", fastest solution\n\nCached2 could be faster if reflection would not be involved. If we want an even faster solution, simply we can make a copy of the sha256.digest type and its methods into our package, so we can directly use it without having to resort to reflection.\n\nIf we do this, we will have access to the digest struct value, and we can simply make a copy of it like:\n\nvar d digest\n\/\/ init d\nsaved := d\n\n\nAnd restoring it is like:\n\nd = saved\n\n\nI simply \"cloned\" the crypto\/sha256 package to my workspace, and changed \/ exported the digest type as Digest just for demonstration purposes. Then using this mysha256.Digest type I implemented Cached3 like this:\n\ntype Cached3 struct {\n    orig   mysha256.Digest\n    result [sha256.Size]byte\n}\n\nfunc NewCached3(fixed []byte) *Cached3 {\n    var d mysha256.Digest\n    d.Reset()\n    d.Write(fixed)\n\n    return &Cached3{orig: d}\n}\n\nfunc (c *Cached3) Sum(data []byte) []byte {\n    \/\/ Make a copy of the fixed hash:\n    d := c.orig\n    d.Write(data)\n    return d.Sum(c.result[:0])\n}\n\n\nTesting it:\n\nvar c3 = NewCached3(fixed)\n\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\\n\", c3.Sum(variantA))\nfmt.Printf(\"%x\\n\", c3.Sum(variantB))\n\n\nOutput again is the same. So this works too.\n\nBenchmarks\n\nWe can benchmark performance with this code:\n\nfunc BenchmarkCached1(b *testing.B) {\n    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\n        c1.Sum(data)\n        c1.Sum(data2)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc BenchmarkCached2(b *testing.B) {\n    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\n        c2.Sum(variantA)\n        c2.Sum(variantB)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc BenchmarkCached3(b *testing.B) {\n    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {\n        c3.Sum(variantA)\n        c3.Sum(variantB)\n    }\n}\n\n\nBenchmark results (go test -bench . -benchmem):\n\nBenchmarkCached1-4   1000000     1569 ns\/op     0 B\/op    0 allocs\/op\nBenchmarkCached2-4   2000000      926 ns\/op     0 B\/op    0 allocs\/op\nBenchmarkCached3-4   2000000      872 ns\/op     0 B\/op    0 allocs\/op\n\n\nCached2 is approximately 41% faster than Cached1 which is quite noticable and nice. Cached3 only gives a \"little\" performance boost compared to Cached2, another 6%. Cached3 is 44% faster than Cached1.\n\nAlso note that none of the solutions use any allocations which is also nice.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor that extra 40% or 44%, I would probably not go for the Cached2 or Cached3 solutions. Of course it really depends on how important the performance is to you. If it is important, I think the Cached2 solution presents a fine compromise between minimum added complexity and the noticeable performance gain. It does pose a threat as future Go implementations may break it; if it is a problem, Cached3 solves this by copying the current implementation (and also improves its performance a little).","279":"This TODO has been removed.

The  inv\n  message contains a set of transaction hashes and block hashes\n  that  have  been  received  by  the  sender  and  are  now  available\n  to  be  requested.  A  node,  receiving  an  inv  message  for  a\n  transaction or block that it does not yet have locally, will issue\n  a\n  getdata\n  message to the sender of the inv message containing\n  the hashes of the information it needs.

If we were to fix the difficulty, then the network could not react to the influx or reduction of computational resources. So when new mining hardware joins the network the expected time between blocks would reduce, while when hardware leaves, the time between blocks lengthens. This has two effects:\n\n\nThe introduction of new currency to the network becomes unpredictable, i.e., when people join the network currency gets created faster and faster, resulting in a hyper-inflation. Financial systems heavily rely on predictability of the money supply.\nThe confirmation times are unpredictable, which is bad when people start leaving the network, we'd wait longer and longer for confirmations. On the other side, people joining the network also has adverse effects, since blocks do not have time to be propagated in the network, resulting in blockchain forks, which in turn undermines the reassurance we get from a confirmation.\n\n\nRealistically speaking, there is no upside of fixing a difficulty. If you're a user, you'd get the same number of blocks (not really since they'd be stale due to blockchain forks most of the time), but the coins you'd be mining are worthless because everybody else also gets a fixed amount for their investment.

You have peers and orderers.  We tend to use the term peer and peer node interchangeably; they are the same thing.  You may also come across orderer and orderer node; again they are the same thing. \n\nAll peer nodes in Fabric v1.0 architecture are validating and committing peers (i.e. they maintain a ledger and run validation checks against blocks of transactions before appending to their ledger and updating world state). Ordering nodes do what you expect they might - play a central role in the ordering of transactions.  We don't need to delve into the specific role of orderers, but as a quick synopsis: responsible for accepting broadcasts of incoming transactions and responsible for delivering blocks of transactions to peers on a channel; with a kafka implementation, the ordering node(s) will actually relay the txs to the appropriate partition in the kafka cluster.

This is because any transaction on Ethereum that causes a state change (meaning you create, update or delete data) requires a transactionObject such as the one seen above to allow your code to be executed on the blockchain. \n\nIn the snippet below, you can see that the pledge function causes a state change on lines 4 and 5. That alone requires that you provide gas for the transaction. In addition, the pledge makes use of msg.value which is the value of the Ethereum amount that you are sending in the pledge, denoted by the value.\n\n1  \/\/ add a new pledge\n2  function pledge(bytes32 _message) {\n3    if (msg.value == 0 || complete || refunded) throw;\n4    pledges[numPledges] = Pledge(msg.value, msg.sender, _message);\n5    numPledges++;\n6  }\n\n\nRegarding your second question, check out https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/wiki\/wiki\/JavaScript-API#web3ethsendtransaction to see the structure of a transactionObject.

Most blockchain full nodes operate completely independently and spend their time validating transactions.  The fact is that every full node in Bitcoin protocol or Ethereum has a full copy of the the entire chain--that is, every transaction that has ever occurred since block zero.  They operate and validate on a consensus basis, so it is truly headless, not a distributed cluster.\n\nHDFS is organized on a node (usually) as \"just a bunch of disks\" (JBOD), meaning they don't even usually bother with RAID.  Replication is accomplished across nodes, but it's not full replication, meaning that there may be 5 copies of a file in a medium or large cluster and there is potential (which increases with the size of the cluster) for disk failures to cause actual data loss.\n\nHDFS scales massively, but is inherently risky and requires a backup strategy.

He introduces the idea of an immutable ledger using an interactive web demo. If you are interested in playing with this on your own, it is available online at:https:\/\/github.com\/anders94\/blockchain-demo\n\nBlockchain was originally developed as the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A vast, globally distributed ledger running on millions of devices, it is capable of recording anything of value. Money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be moved and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established not by powerful intermediaries like banks and governments, but by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and clever code.You can learn more about Blockchain use cases from this TED talk.\n\nEthereum, a type of blockchain that can be used to develop decentralized applications &  several banks have already adapted Ethereum to develop and test blockchain trading applications. The Ethereum blockchain was developed by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin and this blockchain has some extraordinary capabilities. One of them is that you can build smart contracts. It's kind of what it sounds like. It's a contract that self-executes, and the contract handles the enforcement, the management, performance and payment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the contract kind of has a bank account, too, in a sense \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of agreements between people.Also, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Microsoft, Intel, and more than two dozen other companies have teamed up to develop standards and technology to make it easier for enterprises to Ethereum.\n\nSince you are using NodeJs, use Truffle to connect your Ethereum blockchain network.Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier.

Still, it is quite doable. I am going to answer your questions out of order, because that is how the code flows.\n\n\n  How to generate private and public keys and Will I store them alongside user information?\n\n\nYou should not be generating private keys. At the very least, use client-side code to generate them, if necessary. As for storage, you should not be storing them, either. Let the users store them client side, preferably in a dedicated wallet with an API like Metamask.\n\nUnfortunately, your post implies that you mean the Bitcoin blockchain, and I'm not aware of any similar wallets with APIs for Bitcoin... Use the safest available Storage and encryption if you must, but whatever you do, do not send the private keys to the server.\n\n\n  Overall flow from after uploading a document to my website before downloading if successfully signed by all parties (Technically).\n\n\nOK, Lets follow an example document signing step by step.\n\n\nA uploads document to your website.\nB signs document w his private key.\nB uploads signed document to your website.\nYour website hashes the signed document.\nYour website broadcasts a transaction with the signed document hash as metadata.\n\n\nNow lets say A wants to verify that B signed the document.\n\n\nA downloads B's signed copy of the document.\nA hashes the signed document, and compares it to the hash you provide.\nA checks the blockchain for the transaction that includes the document hash.\n\n\nIf all three steps succeed, A can now be certain that B signed the document around the time of the transaction being included in a block.\n\n\n  How to interact to blockchain api. I already gone through the api but nothing make sense to me.\n\n\nThe normal blockchain.com API is not suitable for this use case. You do not have a fine enough control over the transaction content, which is needed to embed the document hashes.\n\nI recommend you use a library like python-bitcoinlib or bitcoinlib-js to create the transaction, and use RPC to a node, to interact with the blockchain.","438":"While Samuel solution clearly works, you loose forever track of how many tokens were destroyed. \nI would instead take the user spent tokens and \u00e2\u0080\u009cburn\u00e2\u0080\u009d them, meaning sending them to a 0x address that locks them in forever. \nIn this way, just looking at the balance of the 0x address, you can see immediately how many tokens were burn in the history of your smart contract.","439":"AlethZero is deprecated for more than a year now and the C++ Ethereum project dead.

Internally, range queries are utilized against the concatenated set of keys.  Therefore, the keys in the query must be provided in the same order as they were modeled.\n\nThe chaincode APIs have been updated in Fabric v1.0 to make the behavior more intuitive.  In v1.0 you can model a composite key and then query on a subset of the keys (again, in the order that they were modeled).\n\nTo query on different combinations of keys, you would have to model each unique combination that you'd like to query on.  Think of these as simple indexes.\n\nIn v1.0 you can also model your data as JSON and utilize CouchDB as the state database.  In this case you can directly query on any field of the JSON.\n\nThere is an example of both data patterns in the marbles02 chaincode here:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/blob\/release\/examples\/chaincode\/go\/marbles02\/marbles_chaincode.go.","441":"Enrolled users can request transaction certificates. Then, these certificates are for invoking Chaincode transactions on the blockchain. I think that these certificates don't let you privacy, they are more to authenticate the owner of the transaction.\n\nHowever, if I were you, I'd start using the v1.0 of the Hyperledger Fabric. \n\n\nThe v0.6 of the Hyperledger fabric is a project developed for testing the advantages and disadvantages of blockchain. They realized that every peer in the network is required to execute every transaction, maintain a ledger and run consensus. So, they can't scale very well and can't support true private transactions and confidential contracts. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EKa5Gh9whgU\nThe v1.0 gives you the chance to creating isolated Blockchains inside your network. That's possible thanks to the channels. When you define a Channel, you define who are the members of it, so, only those peers could send transactions throught that channel. Therefore, only members of the channel could see your transaccionts.\nSo, for your approach, you should create four channels, each one for each supplier. The manufacturinf company should be a menber of all channels.\n\n\nIn my opinion, nowadays there's more information about the v1.0.","442":"Enclose the address in quotes.\n\nchange this myContract.balanceOf(0xf32200730fdaca83f18171015c0be2a6342d46c4) to this myContract.balanceOf(\"0xf32200730fdaca83f18171015c0be2a6342d46c4\")","443":"Worldstate level storage works at the {key,value} level.

A VP has a full copy of the world state and the transaction history in the form of a blockchain. An NVP is merely a conduit to a VP for transactions and queries. Transactions can see uncommitted state, and can thus layer upon themselves to build up a series of blocks. Queries can see only committed state (world state where the transaction is definitely in a block). This introduces hysteresis between transaction and world state changes being visible. Note that visibility has changed iun v1 fabric. \n\n2) Each peer stores all blockchain history.\n\nEach validating peer stores all blockchain history and all world state. \n\n3) When I want to build an application I should provide an interface where a user can make a change, that change will be saved in his peer and consensus network will add that change to all peers.\n\nAn application must be built in the context of one or more smart contracts. A smart contract (also called chaincode) has an API that the architect \/ developer creates for transaction and query processing. The choice of API is flexible, whatever works for your application. The chaincode has access to world state, and so acts a lot like a servelet.\n\nWhen you send a transaction from the application, the peer will package it up and fire it to all VPs and they will perform consensus. If this passes, the transaction will be executed on all. If there is an error on one of the peers, the transaction is failed. \n\nThere is a peculiarity in v0.6 that a failed transaction is not written into the block's transaction array. And if the transaction does not emit an event, it is also not written into the block's event array. This causes it to more or less disappear. I am not certain if there is a rejection event emitted, but I suspect not. For this reason, I always emit a success or failure event from my IoT Contract Platform (https:\/\/github.com\/ibm-watson-iot\/blockchain-samples\/tree\/master\/contracts\/platform) precisely so that my transactions always leave a trail in the chain.\n\nNote that fabric v1 will fix this issue.\n\n4) It should be something like https:\/\/www.altoros.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Hyperledger-Webinar-Thomas-Marckx-architecture.jpg ? So, each application's user send request to application(backend API) and application send request to fabric(user's peer) ?\nIt is my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong or confirm.\n\nThe diagram is pretty free with the generalizations, but what is there is essentially correct. Each peer deploys its own copy of each chaincode in v0.6. This happens automatically because deploy also goes through consensus and is a transaction like any other. Thus, the deploy happens essentially simultaneously on all peers. \n\nChaincode runs in docker containers (or in process in the peer, but ignore that for your own chaincode) and communicates to the peer's docker container over gRPC through a proxy\/stub arrangement called the shim.\n\n--- NOTE ---\n\nFabric v1 is changing this protocol completely, as chaincode will have to be explicitly installed on any peer from which it is to be accessed. V1 has private channels (think sub-chain) that are visible to specific participants (through their captive peers, usually an endorser or orderer if I understand it so far) and so a chaincode will be deployed into a channel that is opened among the participants, but deployment can only be successful if the chaincode is already installed on the peer to be used. \n\nIt is obvious from this that there will be many possible topologies. Each participant may have a peer with many channels on each peer, but not all with the same participants. Some participants may choose to not have a peer and instead use one in the cloud or a peer on the premises of another (presumably trusted) participant. And so on.","452":"To register a chaincode on Windows 10 (in docker container), you need to be in the container\n\nFor this, open a command prompt and go to bash shell using docker command :\n\ndocker exec -it [peer-container-name] \/bin\/bash\n\n\nThis will enable you to use linux commands and register chaincode.","453":"No, but Yes. \n\nIt wouldn't be possible to notify a contract about any contract created, and I don't see an obvious way to notify about all contracts created by a specific user. \n\nBut, there's a way to notify a contract about all instances of a certain species of contract. I suspect this is a reasonable assumption, because the interested contract is probably only interested in a certain type(s) of contract. \n\nYou would implement a factory pattern and get it to deploy the instances. The function that does the deployment would be responsible for required notifications. \n\nHope it helps.","454":"You can not change anything on the ledger.The only way you can update the person infomation is insert a new line to cover the old.","455":"In chaincode API GetStateByRange(startKey, endKey string), the startKey and endKey can be empty string, which implies an unbounded range query on start or end.

If we establish that the user's web3.eth.accounts[0] is proof that the user controls the private key of that account's address, then you will always know that the user is valid.\n\nIf you want to use IPFS like a database, my suggested approach would be this:\n\nNote that with most decentralised systems a lot of the action happens on the client side.\n\nUser Signup\n\n\nUsers have Ethereum accounts.\nOn sign up user data is collected into a JSON object\nA file is created, write JSON object to file.\nPass file to IPFS\nGet file hash (which is basically its IPFS location)\nStore the IPFS hash in an Ethereum contract that associates the user's Ethereum account with the IPFS file hash.\n\n\nUser Validation\n\n\nUser visits the website\nweb3js gets the active Ethereum account\nRead from the user contract to find the associated IPFS hash\nGet file from IPFS\nRead the JSON object\nExtract the data from the JSON\nDisplay data to user","457":"There are two capabilities in Fabric 1.0 that may help you.\n\n1) Chaincode upgrade. Let's say the first chaincode is version 1.

The first chaincode would no longer be invokable.\n\n2) Chaincode to chaincode invocations.  The second chaincode can invoke the first chaincode using the InvokeChaincode() API.\nThis could be done in the Init() function of the new chaincode at instantiation time, to read all the relevant state from the first chaincode and create associated state in the second chaincode. Alternatively, the second chaincode could invoke the first chaincode as needed during traditional invokes, to reference or copy over any state that is needed for a particular transaction.\n\nOf course, to utilize solution #2 then you need correct query functions available on the first chaincode. If you don't have these in place, then you could use a combined solution. First, use solution #1 to upgrade the first chaincode to add the correct query functions that will be needed, and then use solution #2 to invoke these new query functions from your brand new chaincode.","458":"Hyperledger Fabric version 1.0 will introduce channels, which will allow the creation of private channels within the fabric. \n\n\n  \"Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 introduces network channels, which are\n  private lines of communication between specific peers.

The actual synchronization of the peers requires a little more explanation, and depends on some of the configuration parameters set on the blockchain.\n\nBy stopping vp3 you have effectively taken vp3 out of consensus and caused vp3 to advance his view. The Blockchain can proceed fine with only 3 peers participating in consensus, and that is what is currently happening. The other three peers are participating and proceeding as normal, they are happy with the state and view they are at. You may see some messages from vp2 to the other peers with a request for a view change, but as they are perfectly fine without him, they will ignore it for now.\n\nFrom vp3's perspective he knows he is out of line and holds himself out of consensus because of it. If the network stays at its current state (vp3 out of consensus and 1 view ahead and vp0,vp1,vp2 in consensus, all in the same view but one behind vp2) then based on some PBFT configuration variables of vp3 (in the Starter Network you are using, it would be a 40 block window with 10 block checkpoints) he will not worry about synchronization. At 40 blocks behind he will initiate a catch-up via state transfer, but he uses the next two 10 block checkpoints to accomplish this. So you will see vp3 advance his chain only when he is 60 blocks behind the others at current configuration settings. Please note, this just ensures vp3 does not fall too far behind..it will not necessarily put him back in consensus.\n\nYou can find more information on the PBFT in general and the way it is implemented on the Starter Network plan here ==> https:\/\/console.ng.bluemix.net\/docs\/services\/blockchain\/etn_pbft.html\n\nNow, as to re-synchronization, it can happen a few different ways.\n\n1) The other peers for some reason decide to change their view. This could happen for a number of reasons, networking \/ communication issue between the peers, a heavy load where the participating peers decide to vote a new leader they believe might be faster (and hence view change), and some others. When they vote to change their view, they would advance to where vp3 is already waiting. Vp3 would rapidly synchronize himself with the Blockchain and start participating in consensus again. All peers would be in synchronization at this point. This could happen at any time and for various reasons.\n\n2) You can try to \"force\" the issue of resynchronization. This would be an attempt to force the other peers to advance their view to meet vp3. One way of doing this would be to stop vp3. Then stop another peer (for example vp2). Advance the chain by doing an invoke directed to one of the remaining up peers. Then restart vp2, Then restart vp3. This can realign the peers in most cases, although timing can be a factor. There is a chance that either all 4 peers advance their views (still leaving vp3 ahead 1 view) or that the 3 peers will advance their views ahead of vp3 leaving vp3 one behind. If you are just looking to play around and see how the blockchain reacts in these situations you could try this.\n\n3) If you had your own local blockchain using the published docker images here ==> https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/r\/ibmblockchain\/fabric-peer\/ You could set some configuration settings that would would force automatic view changes on certain time boundaries, this would bring an out of synchronization peer back in line on a more consistent basis, but that is not something you can do on the Starter Network on Bluemix you seem to be using (from your screenshot).\n\nHow this would all run, or would be configured, for a real solution environment would depend heavily on the your application and your intended use cases. Peer synchronization can be done at the cost of increased communication between peers, but the idea is not to keep all peers in synchronization as much as it is to insure that what is written to the blockchain has been agreed to through a consensus process.\n\nHope this helps!","472":"Not with 'part' of the Blockchain... but yes using something called 'Snapshots' which is like the relevant state of the blockchain at a given point in time.

Let me give a somewhat simplified answer to not get into too much details and a too long answer.\n\nFirst of all, Ethereum is primarily a public blockchain that works in a certain intended way. Similarly, the Bitcoin blockchain works in a certain intended way. Hyperledger is not like that, rather it's an umbrella for distributed ledger technologies (in my terminology not the same as blockchain) which all aim to provide a very flexible architecture so that one can build all kinds of ledger-backed systems with pretty much any properties needed. One could compare this to an imaginary Bitcoin umbrella that provides technology to produce own altcoins with pluggable parts for e.g. consensus, blockchain storage, node composition etc. In short, all these aim to solve different problems and one should not think one will fit all.\n\nComing back to your questions.\n\n\n  1) Where is the contract stored?\n\n\nEthereum has contracts (called smart contracts) on the chain, i.e. code is compiled to byte code and the resulting bytes are sent within a transaction to be persisted onto the Ethereum blockchain. This is done once when you deploy the smart contract. After this one can interact with the smart contract with other transactions.\n\nHyperledger is in theory not defining this, it could be on a ledger or it might not. Take Fabric for instance, it deploys the code into a sandboxed Docker container which then can be interacted with using transactions.\n\n\n  2) How other participants such as customs and importer can access this contract?\n\n\nShort answer is that they are given access via credentials.\n\nThis is in both Ethereum and Hyperledger open for you to decide yourself. We now assume the code in both cases has been deployed as code on the blockchain for Ethereum and as a Docker container in Fabric.\n\nIn Ethereum the code is, a bit simplified, publicly accessible\/visible which means you need to employ some kind of check to only allow those who should be able to interact with the smart contract to do so. One way is to check the sender (of the transaction) and only allow certain ones. It's similar to traditional systems where one usually needs to authenticate\/authorize to be allowed in and see\/alter data.\n\nIn Hyperledger it would most likely be modelled in a similar manner and e.g. in Fabric there is also the Certificate Authority that hands out certificates that allow access to different parts of the system. E.g. transport, endorsement or transactions.\n\n\n  3) Can we activate participant level access to the contract on the blockchain?\n\n\nYes, so each participant in both systems has credentials and the designer of the smart contract can use this to control access.\n\nAlso, in Fabric there are channels that partition the ledger which is used for access control.\n\nHTH.","484":"My suggestion would be to go and look for a list of popular addresses, i.e., addresses that received and\/or sent a lot of transactions. Most gambling sites will use vanity addresses that include part of the site's name in the address, so you might also just search in the addresses for similar patterns.\n\nIt's rather easy to build such a list using Rusty Russell's bitcoin-iterate if you have a synced full node:\n\nbitcoin-iterate --output \"%os\" -q > outputscripts.csv\n\n\nThis will get you a list of all output scripts in confirmed transactions in the blockchain. The output scripts include the pubkey hash that is also encoded in the address.\nLet's keep only the P2PKH scripts of the form 76a914<pubkey-hash>88ac\n\ngrep -E '^76a914.*88ac$' outputscripts.csv > p2pkhoutputs.csv\n\n\nJust for reference, the 90.03% (484715631\/538368714) of outputs are to P2PKH scripts, so we should be getting pretty accurate results.\nSo let's get a count for each outputscript and count its occurence:\n\nsort p2pkhoutputs.csv | uniq -c | sort -g > uniqoutputscripts.csv\n\n\nAnd finally let's convert the scripts to the addresses. We'll need to do the base58 encoding, and I chose the python base58 library:\n\nfrom base58 import b58encode_check\n\ndef script2address(s):\n    h = s.decode('hex')[3:23]\n    h = chr(0) + h\n    return b58encode_check(h)\n\n\nFor details on how addresses are generated please refer to the Bitcoin wiki. And here we have the top 10 addresses sorted by incoming transactions:\n\n1880739, 1NxaBCFQwejSZbQfWcYNwgqML5wWoE3rK4\n1601154, 1dice8EMZmqKvrGE4Qc9bUFf9PX3xaYDp\n1194169, 1LuckyR1fFHEsXYyx5QK4UFzv3PEAepPMK\n1105378, 1dice97ECuByXAvqXpaYzSaQuPVvrtmz6\n595846, 1dice9wcMu5hLF4g81u8nioL5mmSHTApw\n437631, 1dice7fUkz5h4z2wPc1wLMPWgB5mDwKDx\n405960, 1MPxhNkSzeTNTHSZAibMaS8HS1esmUL1ne\n395661, 1dice7W2AicHosf5EL3GFDUVga7TgtPFn\n383849, 1LuckyY9fRzcJre7aou7ZhWVXktxjjBb9S\n\n\nAs you can see SatishiDice and LuckyBit are very much present in the set.

To accurately measure the effort spent by the network to ensure the unit value of its token , we need a DMMS algorithm(as described in the sidechains paper) & which is nothing but a proof-of-work blockchain.\n\nEach primitive operation needs its own blockchain for its value to be determined accurately.

ctrl+c (i wanted to go out) and that moment i seen in console that execution started to continue and i have seen output you expected, deploying helloworld ... etc... Bud now when i call the method , I get return of '' instead of 'Hello 2018'. On test rpc console when i call method sayHello, i see eth_call.

I double and triple checked my cards. I can understand the need for a card\/connection profile with peers from multiple orgs if the instantiation policy required the instantiation\/start to be endorsed by multiple orgs. But since the default instantiation policy only requires a single endorsement that the transaction was initiated by someone who has channel admin rights, there shouldn't be a need to have information about other peers. May be that is way I was able to execute the step using the '-only' card.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Naveen Sachdeva\n                \n                Dec 15, 2017 at 19:13\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Naveen, the tutorial doesn't specify the default Fabric policy, and it creates a policy file endorsement-policy.json that requires peers from both Orgs (have a read of the tutorial).

Unfortunately, this is the only way (as of 0.19.0) to use chaincode to query the system. You can't return a value from a transaction, so all you can do is fire an event.  One possible issue is that other clients will receive this event as well, so you don't want to put some sensitive data into it.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0ulu\n                \n                Apr 10, 2018 at 13:21\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                addParticipant is natively available - so how would I write a tx which fires for each of these actions?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0dendog\n                \n                Apr 11, 2018 at 14:14\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                If you use the CRUD operations, you won't be able to fire an event.

A block consists of multiple transactions that have been verified by the mining process. The transactions within an individual block don't have to be related (and almost always are not related in the public blockchain). To expand on #2 a bit, you are not required to create a private network to launch your dApp. Some common use cases for creating a private network are to have different environments for dev\/QA, or for security reasons so you can control who mines your transactions.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Adam Kipnis\n                \n                Nov 27, 2017 at 18:09\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Just to add to this, I think it might be worth while to mention that a Block isnt a physical thing, until its written to disk.

Please see clarification I added above. I can't embed images (something about stackoverflow reputation??) but basically the issue is that in the Blockchain Enterprise plan you can access service credentials but in a trial account where you manually install Hyperledger in a container this option is not available.

I would like to use Blockchain for distributed networks of nodes where each node is handling some sensor data or some kind of load where each node is configured with some specific configuration file. Therefore, if there is some change in this file then there should be some kind of certain parameter transfer for re-configuration by other valid node. I am trying to avoid the use of central entity for configuration management. Also, if node fails then there could be some mechanism to transfer or migrate the load of failed node to other valid node.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Akshay Jindal\n                \n                Oct 17, 2017 at 12:48\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Sounds like you want something at the edge to act as a client to the blockchain network, recording sensor data on the blockchain. That's a pretty common use case.   As for the second use case, where you want to automatically detect whether and when a file is changed, blockchain is likely not the solution you would apply. You could store your configuration info on the blockchain, and THAT would automatically recover etc.  However, you would need to access that config info via txns against the blockchain, which may be suboptimal.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0christo4ferris\n                \n                Oct 17, 2017 at 15:28\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","140":"Thank you for the Information, I shall give a try on Parity.

Actually, Geth is not a language. It is Ethereum implemented in GO language that has a command line tool. If you prefer or required to us Geth, you can still use it. However, in your case because you are not really synced with Ropsten network, you have to do one of the mentioned options: Delete the \"nodes\" folder and use GEth with \"--bootnodes\" option. Or, add the nodes using the command: \"admin.addPeer('enode:\/\/ADDRESS@IP:PORT')\". And the most important is to have a healthy node address that you have to explicitly specify.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Muhammad Altabba\n                \n                Nov 17, 2017 at 19:31\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Can I contact you personally, I would like to have some questions to ask you about Blockchain and Ethereum.

Because my understanding was like it should use left-side port and then it will get mapped to the port at the right-side as per the given mapping. So couchdb2:7984 will finally map to 5984.

GetCreator API is really good, i didn't noticed it yet, and helped to get the creatorName. Yes I understand you question about why using 4 peers. Actually in my demo concept, all these peers are from separate companies and the will only one company who will always create the Asset and the remaining are there to take the share of that Asset. So A will always create Asset A1, and B,C & D will get the shares as explained.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Girish007\n                \n                Sep 27, 2017 at 10:04\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                I am sending the same proposal to all the four peers since all are endorsing peers.

While in chaincode you have to build an additional abstraction of those 4 owners of shared asset. Then you can implement ACL based on creator info and restrict that only clients of org A will be available to create assest, while rest orgs will be able to query for their own state. The fact of having 4 peers relays to the trusting model and the org willing to have their own copy of the ledger, endorsement policies will help you to maintain consistent state.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Artem Barger\n                \n                Sep 27, 2017 at 10:11\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Yes, now very close to the point.

So my understanding is that (1) For a peer, in order to verify a newly received transaction or block, it does not need to refer to any information in the blockchain. Verification is just to verify the signature in a transaction or a block. (2)  If a the current block head(B) height in a peer's ledger is H, but this peer receives a new block (B') with height H+10, then the peer will proactive ask its neighbors for all the blocks between B and B' before adding B' to its ledger.

With PoW it is rather hard to have a fixed schedule, since PoW is inherently a random process (otherwise everybody would just sit there for 9 minutes idling and then start mining just for that one second that will produce a block). It's also a problem from control theory to optimize the retargeting interval: too small and we overreact to small changes or luck, too large and we distance ourselves too much from the actual value.

My suspicion is that it's just bitrot. There was a time when the Bitcoin code used a lot of wrapper types to provide formatting members around basic numeric types. (The original author didn't really know idiomatic C++ very well and didn't know that was an anti-pattern.) A lot of that stuff has been patched out, but I suspect that this is old code that builds using Bitcoin's own headers, and hasn't been updated in a long time.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0cdhowie\n                \n                Jun 5, 2017 at 16:56\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Thanks for your answers!

Am I to install the api on the server and call it with my server url? e.g. suppose i host on a server with IP 20.199.399.23 , am I to call create_wallet like this: https:\/\/20.199.399.23\/api\/v2\/create?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0user627341\n                \n                Mar 9, 2022 at 9:21\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","393":"What path would I set for keyValStore?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Jeff\n                \n                May 1, 2017 at 17:03\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                I set my keyValStore to \"\/home\/vcap\/app\/.composer-credentials\" and it worked.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Jeff\n                \n                May 2, 2017 at 1:07\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","394":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","395":"Interesting.

I see how optimistic locking can be used when having a single write side. But if having multiple write sides on different machines (without one common database), they would somehow have to agree on what commands to process.

So essentially in order for the user to interact with any DApp they would need to have mist installed locally which would require the DApp to be a client application.

Would you mind commenting on use of multiple blockchains. Imagine a platform, that let's you create your own blockchain to host any kind of transaction. Such that for 'x' members there's one parent blockchain and 'x' sidechains. These members can be part of other sidechains in the network too.

Since Bitcoin's 10-minute blocks hold a finite number of transactions, you might need to wait longer than that if your transaction wasn't included in the upcoming block.\n\nOn top of that, once your transaction is on the blockchain, you should ideally wait until several more blocks are mined until you're confident that your transaction got included in the globally-accepted branch (the longest branch).\n\nSo, to be safe, if you decide to wait for 6 blocks after your transaction is included, you'd end up waiting an additional hour until you're relatively confident that your transaction has been accepted.\n\n\n  If yes, how can I handle the real-time system requirement in the\n  blockchain?\n\n\nThat's one challenge that Bitcoin hasn't overcome yet. The closest work-in-progress solution is the Lightning Network, but that's still in development.\n\nIn the meantime, some applications might decide to process real-time transactions off-chain by accepting transactions before they're included in the blockchain.

Now, let's put aside the peers. In your chaincode you encode notion of the asset and probably the notion of the users to avoid confusion let's call them persons. So you have 4 persons: Alice, Bob, Charlie and John and business rule which says that once Alice submit an asset it has to be distributed according to 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% respectively.\n\nNext, to continue with say Alice works at Org1, Bob at Org2, Charlie at Org3 and John from Org4. Now you can implement a chaincode which will apply business rule based on whoever submits the transaction. Moreover you can implement ACL based on the submitter identity, hence to prevent from Bob query for balance of the let's say John. \n\nThe legitimate question will be why do I need 4 peers to implement such simple logic. As you can have only one peer with chaincode deployed, channel which configured for all 4 orgs and all you need is to send transactions proposal to invoke the chaincode. \n\nThe caveat in this approach is pretty obvious you need to decide which org will host and run this peer and the chaincode, therefore as all 4 orgs doesn't really trust each other they would like to host they own peer and invoke chaincode against theirs own peers. And in order to prevent each org to trick each other and reduce the influence of adversarial\/non-deterministic behavior they will agree on endorsement policies which actually will make sure that peers of other orgs also receives same results as you during the simulation.\n\nNow back to your question, peers are used to simulate transaction against current state and sign on the results, send results back to the client which aggregates endorsements based on policies and submits results to the ordering service which cuts blocks and deliver them to the peers, which will validate correctness of transactions in the block and eventually commit them to the ledger updating state.\n\nTherefore your chaincode should encode notion of clients\/users\/persons among which you will distribute assets, those users could be mapped back to the client application (real world users), which might be enrolled into different organizations, hence having different certificates signed by appropriate org CA. Finally you will be able to leverage GetCreator API of the chaincode to understand which client invoked the chaincode and apply business logic and access control based on business logic you defined. \n\nSorry for making my answer too long, but to summarize. Your application\/service will be based on two tiers: first one is the application tier - mapped to the user of org, second tier is the peer which holds the ledger and deployed chaincode - to simulate and execute transactions. Hence you will have 4 peers and 4 clients which will submit transaction to the peers and your logic will be based on the client identities rather on the peers.\n\nHope my explanation will make sense to you ;)","188":"Try:\n\n\"0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733c\", 1234, 1235\n\n\nIt's comma delimited\n\nEdit: I've just seen the comment above, there's also a modifier constraint called \"Crowdsale\" can you please provide the code for this too as this could be causing further errors.","189":null,"190":null,"191":"I would advise looking up Medrec when related to health care.

So this is asserting that there is a wide-spread opinion that Git is not a blockchain (an assertion that is illustrated and corroborated by the answers preceding mine on this page) and asking for the reason of the prevalence of this opinion. This is a good question.\nTaking the question literally, the answer could be that the blockchain term and concept gained popularity as part of the digital currency operation called \u00e2\u0080\u009cBitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and hence came to be associated with how Bitcoin does things: which is by using a lot of computing power to calculate a specific hash including a nonce to meet certain arbitrary requirements, which is by allegedly having no central authority, which is by being \u00e2\u0080\u009cindependent\u00e2\u0080\u009d, maybe even \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocratic\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the rest of the kool aid; and as these things are not seen in Git, well, Git cannot be a blockchain, right? And so the question would be answered literally.\nHidden behind this prima facie question is another question: What is a block chain? Now you could look up a definition somehwere and copy it over here, but I didn't do that as I have made up my mind years ago, when listening to a podcast about Bitcoin that strove to explain the new concept of a blockchain, that a blockchain works like Git and I don't intend to let my precious understanding be misled by random claims on the internet.\nSo what is a blockchain? What's in the word?\nNothing in the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cblockchain\u00e2\u0080\u009d presupposes the requirement to include a nonce in the content so as to come up with a hash of so and so many leading zeros. (This requirement is only there to be able to control the blockchain by computing power and so, ultimately, by money.)\nNothing in the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cblockchain\u00e2\u0080\u009d presupposes the existence of a network, let alone a decentralized one.\nNothing in the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cblockchain\u00e2\u0080\u009d presupposes any \u00e2\u0080\u009cindependence\u00e2\u0080\u009d from \u00e2\u0080\u009ccentral authority\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nThe term \u00e2\u0080\u009cblock chain\u00e2\u0080\u009d only presupposes blocks (of data) chained together. Now what is a chain? Is it just a link? No, it is a strong link designed to hold things together by force.\nA simple linked list doesn't qualify as a blockchain because the contents of the chunks of data in the list could be altered while the list would continue to link back and forth just fine. This is not how a chain works.\nTo make a link of blocks of data into a chain of blocks of data, the contents of the blocks need to be checksummed (digested) in one way or another and this checksum (digest) must be part of the link, making it a strong link protecting the content, preventing it from being altered. This is a blockchain.\nAnd this is what Git does, and hence Git is a blockchain, or works as one, if you prefer.\nTo close the circle, let's ask again: Why is Git not considered a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblock chain\u00e2\u0080\u009d?

(Identities will be of course be largest in number, but the system is designed with that in mind, again to my knowledge).\n\nSo my point here is that the limits should be adequate for most practical purposes.\n\nAlso, is there rollback (ACID compliant, example) if the submission of a transaction fails?\n\nThe whole point of a blockchain is to provide a transparent, distributed ledger with perfect consistency at all times. So the answer is yes.\n\nNote, though, that roll-back simply means that at transaction succeeds or fails and that all copies of the ledger will have the identical result. If the transaction fails, then none of its changes will appear in the ledger. \n\nTransaction failure modes:\n\n\nFail during endorsement happens when the chaincode chooses to fail the transaction for violation of business rules or for internal errors.\nFail during commit happens when two transactions execute in parallel (for practical purposes that is -- they could execute too close together and get the same effect) and (a) touch the same keys, and (b) end up in the same block. In this case, the endorsers happily create the read \/ write sets for both, but the committers find that the second transaction is reading an invalid version of a key that was updated by an earlier transaction in the same block. The read \/ write set is never applied, thus providing the roll-back.\n\n\nThe solution to consistent failures during commit is to add flow control into the application. You cannot solve that in the chaincode.","202":"You can get the latest block number over rpc by calling the 'eth_blockNumber' method.\n\nFrom the JSON RPC docs:\n\n\n  Returns the number of most recent block.\n\n\/\/ Request\ncurl -X POST --data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":83}'\n\n\/\/ Result\n{\n  \"id\":83,\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"result\": \"0x4b7\" \/\/ 1207\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other, higher level APIs that you might be interested in, like web3.js or web3.py.

Each block is related with the previous block, so your transaction is throughout all the blockchain.\n\n\n  And will my transaction details be the only details on that block, or\n  will that block contain every transaction that happened within that\n  time period ?\n\n\nIt dependes on the implementation of Blockchain. For example, Bitcoin blocks store all the transactions that have been sent throughout 10 minutes, because each block is mined every 10 minutes (more or less).\n\n\n  Second\n\n\nBlockchain is a distributed system, where all the members are at the same level. So, they get the consensus about what they are going to do, i.e. all the members have to agree about the functions of their Blockchain.\n\nFor each Blockchain, you can have more than one contract.

In either case, think of the state database as part of the peer - there is a 1:1 relationship between peer and its state database.  HA (A\/A) in Fabric, and in blockchain in general, is provided at the node (peer) level.  Transactions can be endorsed by any peer(s) and are then ordered and delivered to all peers in the network. There is natural HA across the network, plus most organizations would typically host multiple peers for 'local' HA as well.  If a peer goes down you route traffic to your other peers.  If a peer or state database becomes corrupt you can rebuild it and it will state transfer blocks from other peers upon joining the channel.\n\n2) The chain is an append-only transaction log on local disk or direct attached storage.

Follow the comments also. \n\nHow does a token contract work?","449":null,"450":null,"451":"1) As I understand, all peers are stored in fabric in VM. \n\nI don't understand this statement. Let me give you a summary.\n\nA Hyperledger fabric is a network of connected peers. In v0.6, the peers can be validating (VP) or non-validating (NVP). A VP has a full copy of the world state and the transaction history in the form of a blockchain. An NVP is merely a conduit to a VP for transactions and queries. Transactions can see uncommitted state, and can thus layer upon themselves to build up a series of blocks. Queries can see only committed state (world state where the transaction is definitely in a block). This introduces hysteresis between transaction and world state changes being visible. Note that visibility has changed iun v1 fabric. \n\n2) Each peer stores all blockchain history.\n\nEach validating peer stores all blockchain history and all world state. \n\n3) When I want to build an application I should provide an interface where a user can make a change, that change will be saved in his peer and consensus network will add that change to all peers.\n\nAn application must be built in the context of one or more smart contracts. A smart contract (also called chaincode) has an API that the architect \/ developer creates for transaction and query processing. The choice of API is flexible, whatever works for your application. The chaincode has access to world state, and so acts a lot like a servelet.\n\nWhen you send a transaction from the application, the peer will package it up and fire it to all VPs and they will perform consensus. If this passes, the transaction will be executed on all. If there is an error on one of the peers, the transaction is failed. \n\nThere is a peculiarity in v0.6 that a failed transaction is not written into the block's transaction array. And if the transaction does not emit an event, it is also not written into the block's event array. This causes it to more or less disappear. I am not certain if there is a rejection event emitted, but I suspect not. For this reason, I always emit a success or failure event from my IoT Contract Platform (https:\/\/github.com\/ibm-watson-iot\/blockchain-samples\/tree\/master\/contracts\/platform) precisely so that my transactions always leave a trail in the chain.\n\nNote that fabric v1 will fix this issue.\n\n4) It should be something like https:\/\/www.altoros.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Hyperledger-Webinar-Thomas-Marckx-architecture.jpg ? So, each application's user send request to application(backend API) and application send request to fabric(user's peer) ?\nIt is my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong or confirm.\n\nThe diagram is pretty free with the generalizations, but what is there is essentially correct. Each peer deploys its own copy of each chaincode in v0.6. This happens automatically because deploy also goes through consensus and is a transaction like any other. Thus, the deploy happens essentially simultaneously on all peers. \n\nChaincode runs in docker containers (or in process in the peer, but ignore that for your own chaincode) and communicates to the peer's docker container over gRPC through a proxy\/stub arrangement called the shim.\n\n--- NOTE ---\n\nFabric v1 is changing this protocol completely, as chaincode will have to be explicitly installed on any peer from which it is to be accessed. V1 has private channels (think sub-chain) that are visible to specific participants (through their captive peers, usually an endorser or orderer if I understand it so far) and so a chaincode will be deployed into a channel that is opened among the participants, but deployment can only be successful if the chaincode is already installed on the peer to be used. \n\nIt is obvious from this that there will be many possible topologies. Each participant may have a peer with many channels on each peer, but not all with the same participants. Some participants may choose to not have a peer and instead use one in the cloud or a peer on the premises of another (presumably trusted) participant. And so on.","452":"To register a chaincode on Windows 10 (in docker container), you need to be in the container\n\nFor this, open a command prompt and go to bash shell using docker command :\n\ndocker exec -it [peer-container-name] \/bin\/bash\n\n\nThis will enable you to use linux commands and register chaincode.","453":null,"454":null,"455":"It is possible to iterate over all the keys in the chaincode state of a particular chaincode using the stub.GetStateByRange() function.\n\nEg: \n\n    keysIter, err := stub.GetStateByRange(startKey, endKey)\n    if err != nil {\n        return shim.Error(fmt.Sprintf(\"keys operation failed.

CERTIFICATE-----\\n\",\n    \"certificatePath\": \"\/certs\/peer\/cert.pem\"\n}\n\n\nThe hostname and port numbers in the URLs must come from the Bluemix dashboard. I find it easiest to get this information by navigating to \"Service Credentials\" and viewing the default credentials \"Credentials-1\". Here's an explanation of where each URL comes from:\n\nmembershipServicesURL is always \"grpcs:\/\/\" + url from the \"ca\" object (url also being discovery_host + \":\" + discovery_port).\n\npeerURL is always \"grpcs:\/\/\" + discovery_host + \":\" + discovery_port from one of the peers listed in the \"peers\" array.\n\neventHubURL is always \"grpcs:\/\/\" + event_host + \":\" + event_port from one of the peers listed in the \"peers\" array.\n\nkeyValStore is a directory on the file system of the system running Composer. If using the Docker images, then use the \"\/home\/composer\/.composer-credentials\" path, otherwise use a directory that exists on your machine.\n\ncertificate comes from the \"us.blockchain.ibm.com.cert\" file which can be downloaded from the \"cert\" property in the credentials, for example \"https:\/\/blockchain-certs.mybluemix.net\/us.blockchain.ibm.com.cert\". If you create this JSON manually, you must ensure that it ends with a \"\\n\" newline character.\n\ncertificatePath comes from the \"cert_path\" property in the credentials.\n\nYou can also get the enrolment ID and enrolment secret to use for Bluemix from the credentials page; I recommend using \"admin\". Note that if you use the REST APIs to interact with the Bluemix service then you cannot use those same credentials with Composer.\n\nOne thing to note however is that the Bluemix Blockchain service can be unreliable due to problems with the event hub connection being timed out due to inactivity. When this happens, Composer will terminate and you may see an error. We are awaiting a fix to the hfc (Hyperledger Fabric Client) Node.js module that will correctly handle this error and reconnect as required.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nSimon","474":"The number of transactions (deploy or invoke) per block depends on timing.  Since the IoT device sent three messages with the same payload, I would image that this happened in close time proximity.  A block is created every second or when 1,000 transactions have been added to a block (whichever comes first).  If the three invocations happened in less than the span of a second, then they would be included in the same block.","475":"For time-locked crypto you can read more here:\nhttps:\/\/crypto.stackexchange.com\/questions\/606\/time-capsule-cryptography \n\nWhen you understand it you will find out that you can limit things by number of calculations required only, which is somewhat a proxy for time required, and thus not guaranteed. \n\nYou will have to build a peer-to-peer system with peers competing over to \"solve\" a vote to their competition and thus make it invalid. Although this wont ensure fixed '30days' it can ensure almost equal time to live for all votes in the network for a certain election round.","476":null,"477":null,"478":null,"479":null,"480":null,"481":null,"482":null,"483":null,"484":null,"485":null,"486":"I had the same thought, and the difference is indeed subtle. I had to think about this awhile. \n\nSuppose you had a hash, BadHash. You pick x' and a random nonce r', compute y' = BadHash(r'|x'), and give me y'. It turns out that if x' is UTF8-encoded English text, I am able to tell you what x' was, and (though not strictly necessary), I can even tell you r'. If x' happened to be just a random bit-string, I'd be out of luck. But no matter, this is clearly not a hiding hash. \n\nNow the puzzle: I give you a value Y', and a randomly chosen value R' (say \"11110011...100\"), and ask you to find an x such that BadHash(R'|x) = Y'. Good news: it turns out that Y'= BadHash(00101...0001 | UTF8(\"Bitcoin is deflationary\")). So because BadHash is non-hiding (plus), you can determine an R (namely 00101...0001), and and x (namely UTF8(\"Bitcoin is deflationary\")), such that BadHash(R|x) = Y' But this doesn't help you, because the puzzle specified that you need an x that works with a different R, namely \"11110011...100\". So you haven't solved the puzzle.\n\nYou see, then, that the two properties aren't equivalent. As to whether there are indeed hashes with one property but not the other -- that I don't know.","487":"Finally, I figured out how to change it\n\naccording to the help, there are two arguments for geth command line:\n\ngeth --help \n\n  --minblocktime value        Set minimum block time (default: 3)\n  --maxblocktime value        Set max block time (default: 10)\n\n\nthe values are in seconds.","488":null,"489":null,"490":null,"491":null,"492":null,"493":null,"494":null,"495":"I took a look at bigchaindb.common.transaction module source code and it looks like there is no Asset name in this module. \nThe reason might be that Asset was removed  in newer version of bigchaindb. \n\nSo are you sure you have bigchaindb_driver version compatible with version of bigchaindb ?","496":"I don't have any documentation to support this now, but Fabric v1.0 seems to have a variant of this feature - with a new switch called \"upgrade\". \nHave not tried it myself. So do not know whether the state can be made available across the different versions of the same chaincode. And the reason for the broken link is the difference in the Chaincode Id between two versions of the same chaincode. \nTake a look at this YouTube video, Upgrade Chaincode. (Please note that this video uses the development mode, so Chaincode can be referred with the given name like mycc)\n\nAlso take a look at the fabric feature enhancement plan here for a mention of this featureFabric next, presentation","497":"You need to install any module locally in order to browserify it. At least, I didn't find any option to get browserify to work with globally installed packages.\n\nSo, in the root of your project, you need to do: \n\nnpm install ethereumjs-tx --save-dev\n\n\n--save indicates the package will not only be downloaded to a local node_modules folder, but also will modify your package.json and write down the dependency, so any further npm install command over that package.json will install ethereumjs-tx with the same version.\n\n-dev indicates that the package will be saved as a development dependency, which means is not a package used by your application in production as a node application: so every package you bundle to be used in the client side should be a devDependency. \n\nWhen you run npm install, npm expects a valid package.json to exist. The warnings npm is complaining about are due to a this package.json not existing in your project, and thus not having some package.json fields such as description. An easy way to initialize a package.json when you don't have one is to run npm init.\n\nIn fact it seems you're creating the bundle at '\/root\/', which seems a strage location for a web project.","498":null,"499":null,"500":"Try stripping out the 'tree\/master' portion of your deployment url.  Notice that the example linked below does not include this portion of the url:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Blockchain\/learn-chaincode#deploying-the-chaincode\n\nThis url is going to be passed into a go get <url> command inside the peer, which will download the chaincode so that it can be compiled.  So, this url must match the format accepted by this command.","501":null,"502":"If you click on the \"Service Credentials\" tab and then look for the \"View Credentials\" link, you'll find the hostname and ports (GRPC, REST, Event) for each peer","503":null,"504":"You can absolutely stream files over swarm. \n\nWhile the routing protocol developed for swarm is likely to be abstracted out so that it can be used for any targeted data\/message transfer (from one participating ethereum node to another) and this may be adaptable to streaming directly from you to your listeners, there is a simpler solution that will work right away:\n\nThe idea is that you upload your music \/ content ahead of time to swarm and then later release the swarm ids one at a time via a different channel, be it whisper messages or an ENS registration change. Coupled with a front-end JS app that subscribes to your feed of swarm hashes and loads the appropriate swarm content, this should make a functioning radio station even with the alpha proof-of-concept version of swarm.\n\ngood luck!","505":"The location where the CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=mycc CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7051 .\/chaincode_example02 command is run appears to be the key factor.\n\nI can replicate the same results that were experienced by running docker-compose up, obtaining the chaincode_example02 code on the Windows host, building the chaincode on Windows, and then opening a new Docker Quickstart window.  I changed directory to the $GOPATH\/src\/github.com\/chaincode_example02 directory and then ran the above command.  The results match the results noted in the question.\n\nRunning the command from within the Docker container for the peer image should produce different results.\n\n\nAfter running docker-compose up based on the docker-compose.yml file, open another Docker Quickstart window.\nNavigate into the file system for the peer by using a command similar to this command: docker exec -it <substitute container name>_vp0_1 bash.  To find the container name, you can first run docker ps.\nOnce in the peer file system, you can check the ports that are being used by reviewing the \/opt\/gopath\/src\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/peer\/core.yaml file.  The \u00e2\u0080\u009clistenAddress\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the peer is noted as 0.0.0.0:7051.\nThe netstat -an command can be used to check that port 7051 is in listening state.\nIf the peer doesn't seem to be listening on port 7051, make sure that the peer node start --peer-chaincodedev command has run.  This should have happened as a result of the docker-compose.yml file since it is the last statement in that file.\nNavigate to \/opt\/gopath\/src\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/examples\/chaincode\/go\/chaincode_example02 within the peer file system and run go build.\nStay in the same chaincode_example02 directory and run

However, in your case because you are not really synced with Ropsten network, you have to do one of the mentioned options: Delete the \"nodes\" folder and use GEth with \"--bootnodes\" option. Or, add the nodes using the command: \"admin.addPeer('enode:\/\/ADDRESS@IP:PORT')\".

GetCreator API is really good, i didn't noticed it yet, and helped to get the creatorName. Yes I understand you question about why using 4 peers. Actually in my demo concept, all these peers are from separate companies and the will only one company who will always create the Asset and the remaining are there to take the share of that Asset.

While in chaincode you have to build an additional abstraction of those 4 owners of shared asset. Then you can implement ACL based on creator info and restrict that only clients of org A will be available to create assest, while rest orgs will be able to query for their own state. The fact of having 4 peers relays to the trusting model and the org willing to have their own copy of the ledger, endorsement policies will help you to maintain consistent state.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Artem Barger\n                \n                Sep 27, 2017 at 10:11,Yes, now very close to the point. In my current chaincode, if A passess Asset A1 to add in ledger, it will execute some chaincode logic and is creating 3 copies of the assets having quantities based on the predefined % division and then writing each Asset json to ledger having separate key which contains company_id.

A strong query goes through full endorsement so that you get the consensus policy applied to the results, which means that at the least you get an answer that the networks considers consistent and accurate at the time.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Kim\n                \n                Oct 2, 2017 at 13:28,However, in neither case does the network make sure that your latest block has been committed to all peers, so the data you think you should see might still be in transit to world state. I.e. if you read too fast after sending an update, you get old data because the query and the update can run in parallel.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Kim\n                \n                Oct 2, 2017 at 13:28,Understood. thanks a lot Kim!

This is OK as that peer distributes the transaction to all of the other peers at submission time, however it does not allow for specifying multiple peers to handle failovers (in case a peer goes down).

Slightly more complicated than \"move X$ from A to B\", but still a simple transaction with a source, target and payload.\n\nThere's ONE Blockchain on Ethereum, it's a chain of Block. And a Block is a list of transactions. And a Transaction is a source, target and payload. \n\nOnce you start writing more complex DAPPs, maybe Ethereum won't be sufficient anymore. Maybe you need to store large files which is too expensive on Ethereum. That's where you may use other PLATFORMS, that are going to use their own Blockchain.\n\nIf you want more implementation details, checkout the Ethereum Yellow Paper:\n\n\n\"The Transaction\" is described in section 4.3\n\"The Block\" is described in section 4.4.\n\n\nEach Smart Contract have their own Merkle Patricia Trie which ressemble a Blockchain but it's more of an implementation detail.\n\nI wrote in more details about how Ethereum Storage works with gas & cost considerations & why you may want to use something else, I hope that can help you.","336":null,"337":"I'm following this tutorial: https:\/\/github.com\/ITPeople-Blockchain\/auction and at the step: \"Build peer and Orderer binaries and Start Orderer\", at the command: make native\n\n\nThe repository mentioned above has been updated about 2 months ago, while while you'd better try to follow more recently updated: Get Started.\n\n\n  Makefile:71: *** \"No go in PATH: Check dependencies\".

A vast, globally distributed ledger running on millions of devices, it is capable of recording anything of value. Money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be moved and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established not by powerful intermediaries like banks and governments, but by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and clever code.You can learn more about Blockchain use cases from this TED talk.\n\nEthereum, a type of blockchain that can be used to develop decentralized applications &  several banks have already adapted Ethereum to develop and test blockchain trading applications. The Ethereum blockchain was developed by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin and this blockchain has some extraordinary capabilities. One of them is that you can build smart contracts.

But like a blockchain guarantees me, I can detect it because my chain cannot verify these commits as being based on it. That's the point with a blockchain, not the decentral consent. And in git I explicitely do not want to have a consent protocol for what I merge (development is not a democracy), but I actually read the new commits when merging them into my chain. So my copy is right, because it consists of stuff I already have and thus can verify (i.e. by seeing merge conflicts) and stuff I review and then accept into it.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0allo\n                \n                May 19, 2018 at 18:08\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    2\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @allo you're correct in that regard, however I stated in the answer \"cryptocurrency blockchains\", not blockchains in general, but I now that I think about it my answer doesn't really seem to fit the question being asked because I was thinking about the system as a whole rather than the underlying data structures\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Miguel Mota\n                \n                May 24, 2018 at 22:25\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                You're completely right about the difference of the block chains used in git and cryptocurrencies.

As you trust Git and yourself, you already have that predefined consensus.\nBut things start to become different, when you are in a Network.\n\nNotes:\n\nFor Blockchains there is absolutely no requirement for the hash to be difficult to calculate or to define something like \"Mining\" or have some specific software which ensures you take part of a certain Network.\nThis all might be a requirement for something like Bitcoin (which usually is referred to as Cryptocurrency, which I cannot fully agree to), but neither is BitCoin defining what a Blockchain is, nor does a Blockchain need to be something like BitCoin.\n\nThe consensus algorithm does not necessarily be something which is based on some cryptographic protocol.  For example it would be enough to publish your TIP in a local newspaper each day to (ab)use Git as some Blockchain.\n\n\nGit readily offers multiple possible consensus algorithms you can chose from:\n\nPublishing the SHA in a Newspaper or similar (something which is distributed and hard to fake)\n\nIf you are in the rare situation that you are already part of some GnuPG Web Of Trust, you readily can use Signed Commits (or Signed Tags) to agree to the consensus.\n\nThe \"Signed off:\" variant does not offer cryptographically secure consensus, but in combination with something like Gerrit and Fast-Forward-Only pushes it is some pretty well defined consensus algorithm.\n\n\nHence to make Git a Blockchain, all you need is to add some air.\n\nSome different view:\nGit is no Blockchain on itself.  In contrast, it is far less than a Blockchain (lacking the predefined consensus algorithm) and much more than a Blockchain (allows a plethora of consensus algorithm to chose from, is meant as an SCM etc.).\n\nSome other observations:\n\nGit branches are the same as Blockchain splits.  While Blockchain splits happen rarely, most Git repositories have less branches (master+HEAD) than BitCoin had splits.\n\nGit always has an explicite consensus done by you, that is, the TIP you push to.  However this only applies to you and nobody else.\nPushing the Git repository to some shared Git Service can also be seen as a consensus.  There is no requirement for such a consensus to be based on Democratic principles.\n\n\n\nVery personal thoughts:\nWhile Blockchain is some overhyped buzzword, something you can happily live without, Git is an inevitable fundamental tool for getting your work done, one of the basic must-haves you cannot live without, something as important as air and water.  This is probably, why people like me do not refer to Git as a Blockchain ..\nYMMV","200":null,"201":null,"202":null,"203":null,"204":null,"205":null,"206":null,"207":null,"208":null,"209":null,"210":null,"211":null,"212":null,"213":null,"214":null,"215":null,"216":null,"217":null,"218":null,"219":null,"220":null,"221":null,"222":null,"223":null,"224":null,"225":null,"226":null,"227":null,"228":null,"229":null,"230":null,"231":null,"232":null,"233":null,"234":null,"235":null,"236":null,"237":null,"238":null,"239":null,"240":null,"241":null,"242":null,"243":null,"244":null,"245":null,"246":null,"247":null,"248":null,"249":null,"250":null,"251":null,"252":null,"253":null,"254":null,"255":null,"256":null,"257":null,"258":null,"259":null,"260":null,"261":null,"262":null,"263":null,"264":null,"265":null,"266":null,"267":null,"268":null,"269":null,"270":null,"271":null,"272":null,"273":null,"274":null,"275":null,"276":null,"277":null,"278":null,"279":null,"280":null,"281":null,"282":null,"283":null,"284":null,"285":null,"286":null,"287":null,"288":null,"289":null,"290":null,"291":null,"292":null,"293":null,"294":null,"295":null,"296":null,"297":null,"298":null,"299":null,"300":null,"301":null,"302":null,"303":null,"304":null,"305":null,"306":null,"307":null,"308":null,"309":null,"310":null,"311":null,"312":null,"313":null,"314":null,"315":null,"316":null,"317":null,"318":null,"319":null,"320":null,"321":null,"322":null,"323":null,"324":null,"325":null,"326":null,"327":null,"328":null,"329":null,"330":null,"331":null,"332":null,"333":null,"334":null,"335":null,"336":null,"337":null,"338":null,"339":null,"340":null,"341":null,"342":null,"343":null,"344":null,"345":null,"346":null,"347":null,"348":null,"349":null,"350":null,"351":null,"352":null,"353":null,"354":null,"355":null,"356":null,"357":null,"358":null,"359":null,"360":null,"361":null,"362":null,"363":null,"364":null,"365":null,"366":null,"367":null,"368":null,"369":null,"370":null,"371":null,"372":null,"373":null,"374":null,"375":null,"376":null,"377":null,"378":null,"379":null,"380":null,"381":null,"382":null,"383":null,"384":"If you encounter this error that means you need to specify a correct docker image tag\nto solve the issue just relaunch the install script it will pull correct cocker images\ncurl -sSL https:\/\/bit .ly\/2ysbOFE | bash -s -- 2.2.2 1.4.9\n\nas indicated here\nhttps:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.2\/test_network.html","385":null,"386":null,"387":null,"388":null,"389":null,"390":null,"391":"Don't store data in smart contracts.
