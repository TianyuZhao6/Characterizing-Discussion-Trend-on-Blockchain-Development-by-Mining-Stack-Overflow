If yes, when will the API of the Bluemix Blockchain service be updated to the latest version?","24":"A validating peer can be started in Hyperledger using the following command:\n\ndocker run --rm -it -e CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=http:\/\/172.17.0.1:2375 -e CORE_PEER_ID=vp1 -e CORE_PEER_ADDRESSAUTODETECT=true -e CORE_PEER_DISCOVERY_ROOTNODE=172.17.0.2:7051 hyperledger\/fabric-peer peer node start\n\n\nWhat is the command to start a non-validating peer?","25":"I'm trying to figure out if the security quality of SSL can be mimicked without the need for a centralized CA.\n\nThere are many questions on here about setting up pure-JS diffie hellman in place of SSL. All of them are roundly refuted, and I think I understand why (although I completely disagree that there's no value in DH-keyed symmetric encryption for the millions of sites which are not going to be implementing full SSL anytime soon either way).\n\nAnyway, question is this: it seems as though the only preventative reason JS DH wouldn't work is that you lose authentication so you're still subject to man-in-the-middle. All the myriad other issues flow from attempts to resolve this one. \n\nBut what if you used a blockchain as a certificate authority? The process would then be \n\n\nForm DH key\nencrypt any handshake string with known public key from blockchain\nencrypt this verify string with DH key\nif handshake string received back, authentication verifies and DH is as secure as SSL DH\n\n\nEdit: didn't mean to imply DH was symmetric, adjusted for clarity","26":"I am following the Bluemix Blockchain tutorial learn-chaincode in GitHub (https:\/\/github.com\/IBM-Blockchain\/learn-chaincode), but it fails when doing the initial build.\n\nThe error message is:\n\n\/d\/work\/src\/github.com\/learn-chaincode\/start (master)\n$ go build .\/\nchaincode_start.go:23:2: cannot find package \"github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\/core\/chaincode\/shim\" in any of:\n        D:\\opt\\Go\\src\\github.com\\hyperledger\\fabric\\core\\chaincode\\shim (from $GOROOT)\n        D:\\work\\src\\github.com\\hyperledger\\fabric\\core\\chaincode\\shim (from $GOPATH)\n\n\nI followed the initial set up of setting up my environment:\n\n$ go get github.com\/hyperledger-archives\/fabric\/tree\/v0.5-developer-preview\/core\/chaincode\/shim\npackage github.com\/hyperledger-archives\/fabric\/tree\/v0.5-developer-preview\/core\/chaincode\/shim: cannot find package \"github.com\/hyperledger-archives\/fabric\/tree\/v0.5-developer-preview\/core\/chaincode\/shim\" in any of:\n        D:\\opt\\Go\\src\\github.com\\hyperledger-archives\\fabric\\tree\\v0.5-developer-preview\\core\\chaincode\\shim (from $GOROOT)\n        D:\\work\\src\\github.com\\hyperledger-archives\\fabric\\tree\\v0.5-developer-preview\\core\\chaincode\\shim (from $GOPATH)\n\n\nThe result is that it populates the directory hyperledger-archives.\n\n$ ls $GOPATH\/src\/github.com\/hyperledger-archives\/fabric\/\nbddtests\/        docs\/      LICENSE          peer\/      sdk\/\nconsensus\/       events\/    MAINTAINERS.txt  protos\/    tools\/\nCONTRIBUTING.md  examples\/  Makefile         pub\/       TravisCI_Readme.md\ncore\/            gotools\/   membersrvc\/      README.md  vendor\/\ndevenv\/          images\/    mkdocs.yml       scripts\/\n\n\nBut as you can see there is no D:\\work\\src\\github.com\\hyperledger-archives\\fabric\\tree.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?","27":"I'm using hyperledger fabric to solve my music streaming security problem. \n\nThe asset in my project are keys that encrypt\/decrypt the mp3 files. And those keys are stored in my ledger. Creators who upload the mp3 files to my media server, keep the keys about those mp3 files. So, Every creator keep a their own ledger. Ledgers are synchronized between the creator peers. And users who want to listen mp3 files will get the key from creator's ledger. So, one transaction is invoked, key is transferred from creator to user.\n\nShould I create a new validating peer once a new creator\/user join my blockchain network?","28":"I'm reading the Web3 documentation and I see that using it in the console requires a running Ethereum node.  But since plenty of DApp users will be new to Ethereum, what are the standard ways of generating new nodes from the browser?\n\nOf course, this can be done with the Geth command line tools - but how does one use these tools in the console?","29":"I recently deployed the fabric network using Docker-compose, I was trying to simulate a downed peer. Essentially this is what happens:\n\n\n4 peers are brought online using docker-compose running a fabric network\n1 peer i.e the 4th peer goes down (done via docker stop command)\nInvoke transactions are sent to the root peer which is verified by querying the  peers after sometime (excluding the downed peer).\nThe downed peer is brought back up with docker start. Query transaction run fine on the always on peers but fail on the newly woken up peer.\n\n\nWhy isn't the 4th peer synchronizing the blockchain, once its up.Is there a step to be taken to ensure it does?

In order to pay the server (from the source of funds), the client (pubkey) PUTs a payment on the resource, where the payment contains a signature over the txid\/vout pair in question (plus some other stuff). \n\nHowever, when the server needs to make use of the value it has received so far from the client, it has to move the above txid\/vout pair on the blockchain, and there is a period in which it is necessary that the client provide payments for both txid\/vout pairs, because the move is not final until the transaction is embedded in the blockchain (which takes roughly an hour or two). The move is atomic, so it will either fail or succeed, but we don't know what will happen yet, so two payments (using both resources) is required in the interim.\n\nSo, if (during the transitional period) the PUT request in question is performed on both resources, everything is fine, and payments can flow as normal. Otherwise, we need to pause payments while the underlying resource has settled.\n\nSo I guess I'm looking for a RESTful way to describe an atomic resource move that takes a few hours to complete. Is there a convenient way to handle this in a RESTful manner? Or do I need to hide this complexity in my application protocol?","86":"I have just started learning GO and ChainCode.

Let's say I have a contract, something like SimpleStorage.sol found in the Solidity documentation , that has a storage state accessible by anyone. As the link describes, \n\n\n  anyone could just call set again with a different value and overwrite your number\n\n\nThis would result in problems, and the solution of restricting the accessibility of that function to specific accounts is not appropriate in my use case. In my contract, I want the data each account sets to later be accessible by a different predetermined account (think of a relationship where person A->B so B uses the data exclusively from A, and x->y where y uses the data exclusively from x. No overlap can exist where y can use A's data). From my understanding, there are 2 solutions to the problem:\n\n\nMap addresses to each other and keep track of all the data within this single smart contract.\nHave a smart contract \"template\" that the initial account would access, and generate a separate smart contract for each new account to simply hold data that interacts with the template.\n\n\nThe problem with 1 occurs when the relationship between accounts becomes more complex (map separate structs?) or a large volume of people try to store their information in the contract.\n\nThe problem with 2 is redundancy. Do I really need to produce a separate \"contract\" for every single person trying to access the main template? \n\nIf my question is vague, I can explain more but I am mostly looking for a conceptual answer. Most smart contract examples I have found are either extremely simple or unnecessarily complex and don't provide concrete use-case.","126":"I've generated some \"raw data\" that is encoded as .datfrom my bitcoin testnet, accordingly I have the file \/blk00000.dat, is this the data of my blocks I've generated? i.e. the transaction data etc.?\n\nIt looks like this: \n\n0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000\n0000 0000 0000 0000 00ff ffff ff03 5301\n01ff ffff ff01 00f2 052a 0100 0000 2321\n02f6 89e4 8543 5d1a 78f9 d08c a612 7e36\n2216 20e1 ad70 7576 dbae 41e7 c01d 406a\nb7ac 0000 0000 fabf b5da b300 0000 0000\n0020 abb4 1583 7333 ff2b fcde f019 f2ad\n4f4d 5c69 462f 277e 1c52 8564 53c2 ab2d\n7674 1c8d de8d e0fa 11eb 9dfe 798d 4839\n5a61 b9d3 439c f4e7 79a5 ebe3 dabe f15d\n2930 d791 7357 ffff 7f20 0100 0000 0101\n0000 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000\n0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000\n0000 0000 ffff ffff 0354 0101 ffff ffff\n0100 f205 2a01 0000 0023 2102 f689 e485\n435d 1a78 f9d0 8ca6 127e 3622 1620 e1ad\n7075 76db ae41 e7c0 1d40 6ab7 ac00 0000\n00fa bfb5 dab3 0000 0000 0000 2026 a3de\n12ea 2f3a deb5 10bf d337 4390 7371 c2d6\n\n\nis there a way to render it as human readable JSON, so I can see it as something like this: \n\n{\n    \"version\" : 90300,\n    \"protocolversion\" : 70002,\n    \"walletversion\" : 60000,\n    \"balance\" : 0.00000000,\n    \"blocks\" : 0,\n    \"timeoffset\" : 0,\n    \"connections\" : 1,\n    \"proxy\" : \"\",\n    \"difficulty\" : 0.00000000,\n    \"testnet\" : false,\n    \"keypoololdest\" : 1413617762,\n    \"keypoolsize\" : 101,\n    \"paytxfee\" : 0.00000000,\n    \"relayfee\" : 0.00001000,\n    \"errors\" : \"\"\n}\n\n\n\n\nEDIT\n\nI have 2 bitcoin.conf files, as I have two nodes, they look like this: \n\n# testnet-box functionality\nregtest=1\ndnsseed=0\nupnp=0\n\n# listen on different ports than default testnet\nport=19000\nrpcport=19001\n\n# always run a server, even with bitcoin-qt\nserver=1\n\n# enable SSL for RPC server\n#rpcssl=1\n\nrpcallowip=0.0.0.0\/0\n\nrpcuser=admin1\nrpcpassword=123\n\n\nIt should be noted that I'm using the configuration that I got from here\n\n\n\nEDIT II\n\nI had a problem with the last step, namely XXX\n\nit resulted in the following error: \n\n\n\nif I had to guess I would say I went wrong on this part \n\n<path-to-datadirectory> where exactlly should that be? where blk00000.dat lives? the whole directory? or exactly that file?","127":"I started a private network with issuing the command:\n\ngeth --datadir=\"~\/datastore\/ethereum\" --port 30303 --rpc --rpcport 8545 --rpcaddr localhost --networkid 554433 --rpccorsdomain=\"*\" --minerthreads \"4\" --mine --rpcapi \"db,eth,net,web3\" --maxpeers 0 --nodiscover --unlock=0 --verbosity 4 --gasprice 100 --gpomin 0 --gpomax 0\n\n\nThen I called a smartcontract.

You can find the Hyperledger project from https:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric. It's a Linux platform app written by GO.\n\nAfter the modification, we had a testing at local vagrant VM servers. All the changes are fine.\n\nNow I try to deploy the updated code to IBM Bluemix via CF App channel. The action failed in compile phase because the basic environment is missing.\n\nHere come my questions:\n\n\nFor bluemix, when I start the Block Chain service, what actually happens behind? Does bluemix start a few VM for me to run the peer nodes?\nAnyone has ever tried to push peer via cf app channel? How to settle the buildpack for peer node?\nWhen the peer node is running, it's listening on 3 ports other than 8080. In my local VM server it's fin. But how can I enable those ports in bluemix?\n\n\nThanks for your ideas and contribution.","140":"I am trying to send reqest from google api script to IBM Blockchain SaaS project Bluemix.\nThe code is:\n\nvar url = \"https:\/\/24f7d912-60f4-4eaf-89c6-b3e34b2247f9_vp1-api.blockchain.ibm.com:443\/chaincode\";\n  var headers =\n  {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n   \"method\": \"query\",\n   \"params\": {\n       \"type\": 1,\n       \"chaincodeID\": {\n           \"name\": \"c86de893fe7203e09add8c47237ffa377814311d9c3cb21ca4d3d5c4eeca65294d801a1f2e5a2d6b22b91096d9c8e42910046d2ab02d295ad0a0fb0b716e9a69\"\n       },\n       \"ctorMsg\": {\n           \"function\": \"query\",\n           \"args\": [\"b\"]\n        },\n        \"secureContext\": \"dashboarduser_type0_953add49d4\"\n    },\n    \"id\": 1\n  };\n  var options =\n     {\n      \"method\" : \"post\",\n      \"headers\" : headers,\n       \"MuteHttpExceptions\":false\n     };\n  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url,options);\n  var responseString=response.getContentText();  \n}\n\n\nThe error message is: \n\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"error\":{\"code\":-32600,\"message\":\"Invalid request\",\"data\":\"Client must supply a payload for chaincode requests.\"},\"id\":null}\n\n\nThe request from Firefix Poster was answered correctly.","141":"For example, two applications are connecting one chaincode, if the action to request \"invoke\" of the same Key-Value pair of chaincode almost at the sametime, what will happen?\n\nIf it is nightmare for Hyperledger Fabric, how can we handle on it? on side of Hyperledger core.yaml setting? or side of chaincode design?","142":"I've installed local service as described here https:\/\/github.com\/blockchain\/service-my-wallet-v3 and it started sucessfully.

The need is to get the cryptographic public key associated with an identifier and to be sure that the key is really associated with this identifier. Though there is no guarantee without a certification authority or WoT the idea is to be sure that the key obtained was the first published in the data structure with the identifier and was not overwritten by a malicious node.\n\nSo if we have an identifier I can get a cryptographic public key and be sure that it was the first key published with this identifier.\n\nI first though of a DHT but a data can be easily overwritten by the node storing the key.\n\nSo I thought of a blockchain data structure for its property of being secure against corruption.\n\nDoes a DHT can be used for that purpose? And how? Can a blockchain be used for that purpose and without the currency involved? Another data structure?","168":"I'm new to IBM Bluemix Blockchain service.

I can give a very good educated guess that the reason why this may be taking so long is the way the serialized blockchain data is structured and the way the linq engine queries that data.  I suspect that your routine is \"hanging\" because the underlying parsing\/querying code isn't optimized.

There you can use the normal shell commands, e.g. apt-get update && apt-get install xinetd telnetd see here. After this you have telnet installed and can use it with telnet <ip>. But you have no understanding what Docker is, so you should learn this first.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0n2o\n                \n                Sep 2, 2016 at 8:05\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    \n                \u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\n            Show 2 more comments","84":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","85":"Why does the client have to perform the request on both resources?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Dave Van den Eynde\n                \n                Aug 30, 2016 at 6:47\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @DaveVandenEynde You made me realize my original explanation was insufficient, and I've rewritten it almost entirely to describe the problem in question.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0runeks\n                \n                Aug 31, 2016 at 12:03\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                There's no way to perform two requests in HTTP and regard them as a single transaction.

Are you absolutely sure it deployed\/wrote correctly? If so, how do you know? Did you query the blocks directly and see what happened? Maybe try submitting deploying\/writing\/reading from postman so that you can isolate whether this is a cc issue, or a javascript issue.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Davis Broda\n                \n                Aug 10, 2016 at 19:03\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    \n                \u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\n            Show 3 more comments","100":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","101":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","102":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","103":"Don't know if this is supported out of the box, but you could always just keep a table of all transactions in your chaincode, and just use a query call to return the table.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Davis Broda\n                \n                Jul 28, 2016 at 16:50\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","104":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","105":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","106":"Please post the exact query that you sent, and exact response you got.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Davis Broda\n                \n                Jul 27, 2016 at 18:35\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @DavisBroda Added.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Alvin\n                \n                Jul 27, 2016 at 18:39\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Do you have privacy turned on?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Davis Broda\n                \n                Jul 27, 2016 at 19:02\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @DavisBroda how do I check if my privacy is turned on or not?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Alvin\n                \n                Jul 28, 2016 at 8:32\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                It's a setting when you start the peers.

What's stopping twitter from editing my tweets and making it seem like I said something I didn't say? Little to nothing.\n\nThis is where a blockchain approach comes in. If twitter stored tweets in a blockchain that others could copy, then any modifications that twitter made to this chain would be caught. Blockchains preserve the integrity of the data within a database. They prevent people from cooking the books. This is of extraordinary importance and value in certain application areas.\n\nIn general, private or permissioned blockchains can be seen as a new method for ensuring consistency in a distributed database, even if that database is an environment of perfect trust. There is an equivalence between how a blockchain prevents two transactions spending the same prior transaction output, and how multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in a relational database prevents two transactions modifying\/deleting the same database row. From the perspective of the MVCC storage layer, there is no such thing as modifying a row in place.\n\nThis means that a permissioned blockchain can provide the same kind of concurrency control as MVCC, but in a distributed database which can be written to from many different locations simultaneously (multi-master replication). A blockchain is certainly not an ideal solution for all scenarios like this, but if the row size is small, transactions affect few rows, and conflicts only happen if someone is misbehaving, a permissioned blockchain can maintain provable consistency through a single hash across many nodes of a distributed database, all of which can write to the data.\n\nWhen it comes to maintaining a shared database between entities with imperfect trust, permissioned blockchains have some great additional features:\n\n\nThe database can contain application logic in the form of constraints on valid transactions. This kind of constraint goes beyond regular database stored procedures because it cannot be circumvented under any circumstances.\nThe database has per-row permissions which use public key cryptography. Furthermore, every transaction presents a publicly auditable proof that its creator(s) had the right to delete\/modify its prior rows.\n\n\nOf course, not by coincidence, these are very relevant features for inter-company financial ledger databases. Signed commitments with immutable history are all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s required for proof of integrity. Moreover, assuming commitments are immutable (transactions can only be reversed by adding a new commitment that reverses the actions of the previous commitment), you only need to keep track of the most recent commitment.\n\nIf the commitment signer is a known entity, a single honest \"auditor\" is all that's required to keep the commitment signer honest.

Essentially, a transaction is committed in just over 10 steps.\nAmandla-3i-Ecosystem\nStep 1\nAn arbitrary Agent decides to make a transaction. This Agent can be embedded in any product, such as an Android mobile application.\nIn this example, the application is transferring money to another user.\nWhat is not shown in this step is that the Agent would need to locate a suitable Trade-Agent to conduct the transaction. This could be hardwired into the application, or it could have access to another Trust-Agent that could forward the details of a reputable Trade-Agent.\nStep 2\nThe Agent describes the transaction it wants to the Trade-Agent which will conduct the complex workflow on behalf of the Agent requesting the transaction.\nNote that the Agent is renting processing power from it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s local Node, and will be charged by the Trade-Agent for all work done. This monitisation means that economic type attacks are not possible.\nThe first thing the Trade-Agent does is contact the Buyer-Brokering-Agent directly.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that the Buyer and Seller do not interact directly, because Trust-Agents need to witness each transaction so that Brokering-Agent don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t oversell their currency at a high rate of exchange. An analogy would be a government printing too much money. It would be the Trust-Agents that would need to signal a devaluation in the appropriate Brokering-Agent currency if they witnessed this economic theft from taking place.\nStep 3\nJust after informing the Buyer-Brokering-Agent of the upcoming transaction, the Trade-Agent connects with a number of Trust-Agents that will witness the transaction. This could be a high number (possibly as much as 7 or more) of Trust-Agents. It is in the interest of the Trade-Agent to authenticate this transaction with a high degree of trust in order for the Trade-Agent to maintain its credibility on the network, since it is also rated by other Trust-Agents. It is likely to choose agents that have verified their execution and code to ensure there is no cheating. Only 2 Trust-Agents are shown on the diagram for descriptive purposes.\nStep 4\nThe Trust-Agents begin the chaperoned trade by connecting to the same Buyer-Brokering-Agent and present the trade that they intend to witness.\nStep 5\nIn the meantime, the original Trade-Agent connects to the seller and establishes the upcoming trade.\nStep 6\nAlso simultaneously, the Trust-Agent also connects with the Seller-Brokering-Agent and signals their role as witness.\nStep 7\nOnce the Seller-Brokering-Agent is informed of the transaction, it also makes a connection directly with the Buyer-Brokering-Agent and performs the chaperoned transaction.\nStep 8A and Step 8B\nBoth the Buyer-Brokering-Agent and the Seller-Brokering-Agent connect to each of the Trust-Agents that are witnessing the transaction as part of the authentication process.\nStep 9\nThe Trust-Agents confirm that the transaction was successful.\nStep 10\nThe Trade-Agent completes the transaction.\nDistributed Ledger Transaction Diagram\nExample call\nSample call","52":"The geth.ipc gets created when Geth is succesfully launched.It looks like\nanother Geth instance is already running,which could be stopping the succesful launch.Find that Geth process and kill it.\n\nps -eaux | grep \"geth\"\n\n\nGet the process id and kill that process using\n\nkill -9 <pid>\n\n\nNow invoke geth and attach to it","53":"this is harmless, the hfc module should still work despite the warning.

The correct\n  ordering of transactions is critical, because many types of network\n  transactions have a dependency on one or more prior transactions\n  (account debits often have a dependency on prior credits, for\n  example). On a blockchain network, there is no single authority that\n  determines the transaction order; instead, each blockchain node (or\n  peer) has an equal say in establishing the order, by implementing the\n  network consensus protocol. Consensus, therefore, ensures that a\n  quorum of nodes agree on the order in which transactions are appended\n  to the shared ledger. By resolving any discrepancies in the proposed\n  transaction order, consensus guarantees that all network nodes are\n  operating on an identical blockchain. In other words, consensus\n  guarantees the integrity and consistency of blockchain network\n  transactions.\n\n\nNevertheless in current version there is a leader (one of validation peers) who is responsible for ordering transactions before they are executed by other peers.\n\nIn next Fabric\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version this behavior can be changed (Next Consensus Architecture Proposal):\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n\n  A peer communicates with the consensus service and maintain the\n  blockchain state and the ledger. Such peers receive ordered state\n  updates from the consensus service and apply them to the locally held\n  state\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n\n  Peers are clients of the consensus service, to which the consensus\n  service provides a shared communication channel offering a broadcast\n  service for messages containing transactions. Peers connect to the\n  channel and may send and receive messages on the channel. The channel\n  supports atomic delivery of all messages, that is, message\n  communication with total-order delivery and (implementation specific)\n  reliability. In other words, the channel outputs the same messages to\n  all connected peers and outputs them to all  peers in the same logical\n  order. This atomic communication guarantee is also called total-order\n  broadcast, atomic broadcast, or consensus in the context of\n  distributed systems. The communicated messages are the candidate\n  transactions for inclusion in the blockchain state.","88":"I don't know where to start ... download Ethereum?

Currently the blockchain growth of Bitcoin is roughly less than 100mb a day. Today (2016) the bitcoin blockchain takes up about 60-100GB of space which took about 6 years to accumulate. It is indeed growing faster, but also limited by the blocksize cap of 1MB per block (every 10 minutes). Some proposed solutions have been:\n\n\nSPV nodes: This is how your phone doesn't need to download the entire blockchain, but retrieve its data from SPV nodes that have the entire blockchain.\nLightning network - This is how Bitcoin can overcome the 1MB memory cap.\n\n\nThose are just some of the solutions for bitcoin that I know of, as for altcoin related solutions. NXT\/Ardor has implemented the solution of pruned data, because NXT\/Ardor gives the ability to upload arbitrary data and messages onto its blockchain, the bloat is much more apparent in this scenario. The NXT\/Ardor blockchain has the ability to delete previous data every 2 weeks and only keep the hash of its data on the blockchain which only takes a few KB. They also have the ability to retain all of the blockchain data with the pruning turned off which would mark a node as an Archival Node and other nodes can replicate this node and become an Archival node. \n\nFrom my understanding NXT\/Ardor has been one of the few blockchains that has production ready decentralized data storage system, marketplace, stock exchange, and messaging system built into its blockchain.","113":"\u00e2\u0080\u009cInvoke\u00e2\u0080\u009d is not a synchronous call.

Fabric v1 uses a different mechanism. The steps are (to the best of my current knowledge):\n\n\nClient sends transactions to Endorser(s).\nEndorsers execute transaction, generating world state key \/ value change sets, which are called the Read\/Write Set. Endorser(s) return result to client.\nClient receives responses from all and compares result and R\/W Set against endorsement policy.\nClient forwards successful endorsement to ordering service, which creates blocks from a set of transactions. \nOrdering service forwards complete block to all committers (endorsers, observers, and so on).\nEach committer applies the transactions' R\/W Sets in order, updating each read key's version as it goes along (uses a hashmap, obviously). While committing each set, it performs a check on each key's version in the read set such that the key version must not be less than the current version number. \n\n\nNOTE: This is a major change from v0.6 in that only fully committed transactions can be seen by reads, even in the context of an invoke! If there is any key clash present, the transaction is failed, at the last minute! No chaincode events are emitted, but the failure is logged in the final block. World state changes are lost and the transaction must be resubmitted by the client!\n\nThe fix for this is to design your chaincode to not use shared keys for every asset, or to design your client to flow control API calls (chaincode events, whatever you want to call that) at the asset level, or most likely both.\n\nThe original question's answer is thus that the transactions both work fine on v0.6 Fabric and that the first transaction works but the second fails on Fabric v1 if the two are sent too closely together (and simultaneous is too close).\n\nObviously, when there is no key clash, both always work (assuming that the transaction passes consensus and is deterministic -- as in creating the same result on all endorsers).","142":"I'm confused where are you coming up with those functions? setServiceURL() credentials() getBalance()   \n\nAre you using a custom library or wrapper?    \n\nThe wallet service works off of GET requests sent to the service on localhost at the port that you told it to run on. \n\nHere's an example:    \n\n$url = \"http:\/\/127.0.0.1:3000\/merchant\/YOUR-GUID\/address_balance?address=1someBitcoinAddy&password=YOUR-PASSWORD&api_code=YOUR-API-CODE\";\n$ch = curl_init();\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\ncurl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);\n$ccc = curl_exec($ch);\n$json = json_decode($ccc, true);\necho \"<pre>\";\nvar_dump($json);\necho \"<\/pre>\";\n\n\nA list of the available GET commands are available on their API documentation page: https:\/\/blockchain.info\/api\/blockchain_wallet_api","143":"During \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeploy\u00e2\u0080\u009d the chain code is submitted to the ledger in a form of transaction and distributed to all nodes in the network.

Two things are to note, however.\n\n1.) The size of the blockchain is determined by a number of factors - it does not have to be Bitcoin-sized!

This is what is happening to you.\n\nThe Bluemix blockchain service is returning two type1 usernames (type1 is the type of enrollID these apps want to use). \n\n\ncp-web will register the first and second enrollID against peer vp1 \nmarbles will register the first enrollID against vp1 and the 2nd enrollID against vp2\n\n\nTherefore when you ran marbles after cp-web it tried to register the 2nd enrollID against vp2 when it had already been registered with vp1.  Thus giving  you an error.","169":"Looks like you haven't installed rocksdb library","170":"I had the same problem earlier.

So, by using sharding, we can split and store data across systems which make it scalable. I used BigchainDB for about 6 months(with sharding) and I didnt face any lags because of sharding. I would say, it was faster than ethereum and bitcoin.  There are many drawbacks as well. For eg: if we drop database in one node of a cluster, it merely replicates and deletes the whole database in all nodes.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Lakshminarayanan\n                \n                Feb 21, 2017 at 14:25\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","5":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","6":"1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                I completely forgot about this question. @Hey24sheep solved the problem, though I don't have full local node available now.

I'm not terribly familiar with CloudFoundry, but I'm not sure what you are trying to do is possible in a sensible manner. Fabric 0.6 peers manage their chaincode execution environments themselves - i.e. the lifecycle of the Docker containers that they use for chaincode execution. Can a container in CF do that? I know that \"Docker nesting\" is possible, but does CF support this? (Let alone the fabric environment.) What worked for us is setup and deployment into VMs (AWS). That leaves in place most of the known \"deployment logic\".\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Imre Kocsis\n                \n                May 5, 2017 at 11:07\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                CF should be able to do this as of early 2017 because it has container-to-container networking so can enable multiple ports.

The correct\n  ordering of transactions is critical, because many types of network\n  transactions have a dependency on one or more prior transactions\n  (account debits often have a dependency on prior credits, for\n  example). On a blockchain network, there is no single authority that\n  determines the transaction order; instead, each blockchain node (or\n  peer) has an equal say in establishing the order, by implementing the\n  network consensus protocol. Consensus, therefore, ensures that a\n  quorum of nodes agree on the order in which transactions are appended\n  to the shared ledger. By resolving any discrepancies in the proposed\n  transaction order, consensus guarantees that all network nodes are\n  operating on an identical blockchain. In other words, consensus\n  guarantees the integrity and consistency of blockchain network\n  transactions.\n\n\nNevertheless in current version there is a leader (one of validation peers) who is responsible for ordering transactions before they are executed by other peers.\n\nIn next Fabric\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version this behavior can be changed (Next Consensus Architecture Proposal):\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n\n  A peer communicates with the consensus service and maintain the\n  blockchain state and the ledger. Such peers receive ordered state\n  updates from the consensus service and apply them to the locally held\n  state\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n\n  Peers are clients of the consensus service, to which the consensus\n  service provides a shared communication channel offering a broadcast\n  service for messages containing transactions. Peers connect to the\n  channel and may send and receive messages on the channel. The channel\n  supports atomic delivery of all messages, that is, message\n  communication with total-order delivery and (implementation specific)\n  reliability. In other words, the channel outputs the same messages to\n  all connected peers and outputs them to all  peers in the same logical\n  order. This atomic communication guarantee is also called total-order\n  broadcast, atomic broadcast, or consensus in the context of\n  distributed systems. The communicated messages are the candidate\n  transactions for inclusion in the blockchain state.","88":"I don't know where to start ... download Ethereum?

Endorser(s) return result to client.\nClient receives responses from all and compares result and R\/W Set against endorsement policy.\nClient forwards successful endorsement to ordering service, which creates blocks from a set of transactions. \nOrdering service forwards complete block to all committers (endorsers, observers, and so on).\nEach committer applies the transactions' R\/W Sets in order, updating each read key's version as it goes along (uses a hashmap, obviously). While committing each set, it performs a check on each key's version in the read set such that the key version must not be less than the current version number. \n\n\nNOTE: This is a major change from v0.6 in that only fully committed transactions can be seen by reads, even in the context of an invoke! If there is any key clash present, the transaction is failed, at the last minute! No chaincode events are emitted, but the failure is logged in the final block. World state changes are lost and the transaction must be resubmitted by the client!\n\nThe fix for this is to design your chaincode to not use shared keys for every asset, or to design your client to flow control API calls (chaincode events, whatever you want to call that) at the asset level, or most likely both.\n\nThe original question's answer is thus that the transactions both work fine on v0.6 Fabric and that the first transaction works but the second fails on Fabric v1 if the two are sent too closely together (and simultaneous is too close).\n\nObviously, when there is no key clash, both always work (assuming that the transaction passes consensus and is deterministic -- as in creating the same result on all endorsers).","142":null,"143":"During \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeploy\u00e2\u0080\u009d the chain code is submitted to the ledger in a form of transaction and distributed to all nodes in the network.

After that container will be started and Init method will be executed. \n\nDuring \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuery\u00e2\u0080\u009d - chain code will read the current state and send it back to user.

These smart contracts are similar to real world contracts only that they are not governed by any courts but by the blockchain network itself .\n\nWhereas chain dot com provides a Chain Core  - an enterprise-grade distributed system that powers secure, scalable, and highly available blockchain networks.

Two things are to note, however.\n\n1.) The size of the blockchain is determined by a number of factors - it does not have to be Bitcoin-sized! (Incidentally, even that isn't unmanageably large; https:\/\/blockchain.info\/charts\/blocks-size) There is even thinking about using Blockchain in IoT settings (see K. Christidis and M. Devetsikiotis, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlockchains and Smart Contracts for the Internet of Things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d IEEE Access, vol. PP, no. 99, pp. 1\u00e2\u0080\u00931, 2016.).\n\n2.) In many Blockchain use cases, not all nodes \"need\" to store every block since the first (genesis) one. I think \"pruning\" is even discussed in the original Satoshi paper. My knowledge is very limited on this (I think this is only being discussed for Bitcoin and not implemented yet); that being said, I think it is reasonable to assume that Hyperledger can be modified to support various pruning strategies.

Is block chain just a concept and HyperLeder, an implementation of that concept?\n\n\nI would say it really depends on your definition of a blockchain (originally spelled \"block chain\" like you have above).\n\nThe original definition can be found here in the comments of the Bitcoin cpp code base.\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/blob\/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\/main.h#L807-L812\n\nand here.\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/blob\/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\/main.h#L1014-L1019\n\nI believe one defining characteristic of a blockchain is immutability. If a blockchain's history can be changed with collusion it's not a blockchain imho. I'm under the impression that any private\/permissioned blockchain cannot make such guarantees, because if something needs or is wanting to be changed you can easily collude to make the change like a normal database (not to be confused with append only changes). Bitcoin makes this very difficult because of PoW (proof of work), if you wanted to change the past you would need miners to rewrite all the blocks afterwards which is very costly.\n\nAt a minimum I would at least prefix it like... fabric enables implementation of \"private\/permissioned\" blockchain. It's really up to the community and groups like fabric to define what \"private\/permissioned blockchain\" means.\n\n\n  Where does the hyperledger fabric store the transactions? I understand\n  that its a p2p architecture and every peer has a copy of the\n  transactions, but usually these transactions is a growing set. Does\n  every peer has a copy of growing transactions? I am not clear on this\n  yet. Does the community recommend any database?\n\n\nThey are doing a lot of development on fabric and I believe even changing up the tech stack they are using with minor releases, So it is hard for me to know what they are up to at the moment.\nTheir latest guide here:\n\nhttp:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/glossary.html\n\nor look at their codebase here:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/hyperledger\/fabric\n\nLooks like they moved to rocket chat, their devs are helpful with technical questions.\nhttps:\/\/chat.hyperledger.org\/home\n\nOne interesting thing is, I've talked with their devs in the past about these same questions and the answer I came away with, is they are using couchdb to hold state and apache kafka as the core \"blockchain piece\".

is Blockchain?\nBlockchain is a concept. At core it is just a database. It is Decentralised, Distributed, Immutable Database.  \n\nWhat is Hyperledger Fabric?\nHyperledger is an umbrella project hosted by the Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Fabric is one of this project.\nHyperledger Fabric is an implementation of Blockchain Concept.\nIt is private \/ permission network.\nIt is a Distributed Ledger Technology.\nNow it's confusing? It is designed in a way that if implemented correctly it will be decentralised else it is a distributed ledger.  \n\nWhere does it store the transaction?\nAll the peers on the network and the channels everyone has there own separate ledger and the transactions get stored in it.  \n\nDoes every peer has a copy of growing transactions? Yes, in this way peer can verify if transaction is compromised or not.  \n\nDoes the community recommend any database?\nA ledger contains two things in it: 1. Blockchain , 2. World State\nBlockchain contains all the transactions in it as transaction log in a file\nWorld State store states of the chaincode in database. For all the operation on chaincode it use world state to do modification in blockchain and save the latest state in it.\nThere are 2 DBs recommended by community:\n1. LEVEL DB : For Development\n2. Couch DB : For Production  \n\nIn documentation it is mentioned as pluggable so maybe we can use other DBs but with some work around.","11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":null,"93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":null,"100":null,"101":null,"102":null,"103":null,"104":null,"105":null,"106":null,"107":null,"108":null,"109":null,"110":null,"111":null,"112":null,"113":null,"114":null,"115":null,"116":null,"117":null,"118":null,"119":null,"120":null,"121":"npm i truffle does the exact same thing as npm install -g truffle except that installs it globally, and without -g it will be installed on the local folder.
