                This only partially true. The blocks itself are just memory dumped into the files. However, bitcoin maintains a LevelDB database for open transactions in the chainstate directory.

I have been looking inside various projects and all I see is doing ensure_signed(origin)?.
My question is how actually should I get something like public key or wallet address from that origin value. I believe something must be inside Signed(AccountId) variant. But in test files of several examples and tutorials all i see is they simply pass Origin::Signed(1). What am I supposed to do with that 1?
I am pretty starting out in these blockchain things so any kind of knowledge is highly appreciated",rustblockchainethereumsubstratemetamask,,Sudip Ghimire,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                The ensure_signed function returns an AccountId, aka Public key.   Test use Origin::Signed(1) to create a mocked origin for AccountId 1.   Edit for pressing Enter too early.

According to the comments on this issue, the lack of a version option is intentional.

However, if I have clients using a variety of interface versions, would I not also want to maintain old chaincode versions to accept those old client data formats?

I understand that I can filter the client data in my server-side programs before sending invoke to the peer, but it seems that allowing multiple chaincode versions would allow for more flexibility.  Can we expect a version option for chaincode invoke sometime in the future?",hyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledgeribm-blockchain,,sean,"Add a comment

I'm working on a Project to upload files on IPFS from the Front-End using React JS (web), For that I'm using ""ipfs-api"" Module provided by IPFS Community.
Now what I want, I want to upload file with the ""AES"" encryption, 
Means :- 

For Uploading to the IPFS :- 
1. I've got the file from user
2. converted to buffer and encrypted it using crypto(module)
3. Converted Encrypted String to buffer to upload IPFS
4. Got the Hash for the Encrypted file

Now for getting original file:-
1. Get the file from the IPFS (means got the encrypted data of the file ) using ipfs.cat method


Decrypted the file (using same crypto ""aes-128-cbc"")


(gives me raw or IDK data of the file in the format, I'm getting if log that data in the

�PNG

���
IHDR�� �� X ���Y�g���� sBIT ��O���� tEXtSoftware�gnome-screenshot� �>�� �IDATx���{\�u���� �5 ���&quot;( �


a long data


So please let me know what to do with that data, I think I need to save it but how to save this in a file like format of PNG or something what to do with it.


Code I'm using for uploading :- 

 onSubmit = async event => {
    event.preventDefault();

    var mykey = crypto.createCipher(""aes-128-cbc"", ""mypassword"");
    var mystr = mykey.update(this.state.buffer, ""utf8"", ""hex"");
    mystr += mykey.final(""hex"");

    console.log(mystr);

    const buffer1 = await Buffer.from(mystr);

    await ipfs.add(buffer1, (err, ipfsHash) => {
      console.log(err, ipfsHash);

      this.setState({ ipfsHash: ipfsHash[0].hash });
    }); //await ipfs.add
  }; //onSubmit


Code for Getting the Data :- 

  onClick = async () => {
    try {
      console.log(""-----------------------------------------"");

      ipfs.cat(this.state.ipfsHash, (err, result) => {
        console.log(err, result);
        let r = result.toString();
        let r1 = Buffer.from(r);
        let mykey1 = crypto.createDecipher(""aes-128-cbc"", ""mypassword"");
        let m = mykey1.update(r, ""hex"", ""utf8"");
        m += mykey1.final(""utf8"");
        console.log(typeof m);
        this.setState({ fileDat: m });
        console.log(this.state.ipfsHash);

                Also to help you a bit if it's still not figured out ... it might be an issue that you are getting raw file with unknown format. If you try using ipfs get ""somehashofsomefile"" from command line you will see that you will get protobuf hex file which you have to rename to something like ""thisfile.mp4"" or whatever the extension was and then you will be able to operate with it.

The configuration I'm using is the 7nodes example. (https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples)

I ended-up with 200 Tx/sec. When I checked the logs I found that constellation-node is logging ""Too Many Open Files"" while trying to connect to other constellation nodes using Unix IPC.

I raised the soft and the hard limits of file descriptor to 1 million with no use as it seems that constellation-node is not honoring the limit. By listing the file descriptors under /proc//fd I'm always getting less than 1024 files.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here and I hope that someone can help.

By entities I mean to say consensus mechanism will evolve around these six entities, so for this I need to build a distributed database. Two approaches came into my mind

One approach of achieving this is to completely built everything from scratch: Separate database for each node in sqlite and then connect each node with some type of query.

Another approach is to use bigchainDB server which is a distributed database server based on blockchain.

Now my question which approach is feasible? I don't know whether bigchainDB server is compatible with django or not since they haven't mention anything about it in their docs.

If anyone have use bigchainDB please help me out. I am really confused as to which approach should I follow.",djangosqliteblockchaindistributed-databasebigchaindb,"Apr 28, 2017 at 6:49",Manfred Radlwimmer,"Add a comment

I'm trying to send a broadcast to the Cosmos Blockchain, via the Terra Pisco/Rebel1 Api.
LUNA2: https://pisco-lcd.terra.dev/swagger/#/
LUNC: https://rebel1.grouptwo.org/swagger/#/
When I run the simulation Api, the transaction works perfectly.
However when I run a transaction just via the standard api, it fails with a ""signature verification failed"" error.
This issue is related to the signature being passed to Cosmos not containing the correct Chain-Id or Sequence Number. However I've confirmed that the base64 has it. And all the payloads being sent are correct (Protobuf & Rest JSON), according to the Cosmos SDK support team.
I have generated an issue in the cosmos-sdk repo below (it contains all the details, models, dtos, protos, I pass cosmos):
https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14789

I've verified the Protobuf data according to terra-money's terra.js library
https://github.com/terra-money/terra.js. And the data looks correct.

I've also confirmed that the signature contains the correct Chain-Id & Sequence number.


This issue is related to the C# SDK that I'm currently building. It allows users to broadcast Tx data to Terra (Cosmos).

This is what I have right now:

        // Create the MintTo struct for our context
        let cpi_accounts = MintTo {
            mint: ctx.accounts.mint.to_account_info(),
            to: ctx.accounts.token_account.to_account_info(),

        let cpi_program = ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info();
        // Create the CpiContext we need for the request
        let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new(cpi_program, cpi_accounts);

        // Execute anchor's helper function to mint tokens
        token::mint_to(cpi_ctx, 10_000_000_000)?;

    pub token_account: UncheckedAccount<'info>,
    /// CHECK: ugh

this does mint the tokens, if I pass the mint's authority (any account holding SOL) as owner. Again for clarity: I want this program to be the mint authority for the token, but the user receiving the tokens to pay the fee.

Initially, the connection was made according to this guide.
Everything worked, but as soon as I restart the application, an error appears:

ReferenceError: Property 'Buffer' doesn't exist, js engine: hermes
ERROR Invariant Violation: Module AppRegistry is not a registered
callable module (calling runApplication). A frequent cause of the
error is that the application entry file path is incorrect.
This can also happen when the JS bundle is corrupt or there is an early initialization error when loading React Native., js engine:
hermes

Then I comment on these lines in Live reloading mode
const Web3 = require('web3')
const web3Rospen = new Web3('https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/myKey')

I save the code, the application works, again, in Live reloading mode, I uncomment these lines back - the application works.
But initially, just taking and running the application from web3 does not work. Maybe someone faced such a problem?

I have the following problem:

I have a raffle. The giveaway ends if it is canceled by whoever created it or all the pieces are sold.
Users (accounts) can buy zero, one or several pieces. each time a part is purchased, the user's Pubkey is stored in a list, along with the part they purchased.
Only who defines the draw, receives the money from him when the draw ends. here I am making use of smart contracts and PDA.
If the draw is cancelled, the money must be returned to each participant and the ownership of each piece reverts to its original owner, that is, who defined the draw.

My question is: how can I program the last condition?

Using the close function, do I close the PDA accounts and automatically return the statuses of the user accounts to the way they were?
Using the Pubkey of each user, I search for the associated account and make a transfer from the PDA to each account?",blockchainanchorsolana,,krl,"Add a comment

But it is an error when used. I've tried a lot to fix the error, but it doesn't work. To get lib.js file in cardano-crypto.js, first I have to install npm. I did that. Then came the lib.js file. Then I tried to import cardano-crypto.js's mnemonicToRootKeyPair function to my react-native wallet. But there is an error. To solve the error, first I tried to import cardano-crypto.js with node module. Then I tried to import without node_module. I have imported in several ways.

import {} from 'path'

,

_importDefault (require ('path'))

. But somehow Cardano-crypto.js's mnemonicToRootKeyPair could not run/import. Error says lib.js: path could not be found. But the lib.js file is there. Now how do I solve this how to use mnemonicToRootKeyPair of cardano-crypto.js in our react native wallet?
This is the cardano-crypto.js mnemonicToRootKeyPair function code that I want to use:
async function mnemonicToRootKeypair(mnemonic, derivationScheme) {
  validateDerivationScheme(derivationScheme)

  if (derivationScheme === 1) {
    return mnemonicToRootKeypairV1(mnemonic)
  } else if (derivationScheme === 2) {
    return mnemonicToRootKeypairV2(mnemonic, '')
  } else {
    throw Error(`Derivation scheme ${derivationScheme} not implemented`)
  }
}

And this is the error when I use the function in my react native wallet:

I can see that some opcodes of block number 192 were executed before opcodes of block number 191. How that can be possible? or how are the data of blocks processed while syncing in a full sync mode.
Reason why that can't be possible: There is only one state trie(which gets updated after every block) that acts as a single global truth in full node unlike archive node which has many state trie . So the block number 192 needs an initial state trie(which is state trie generated after processing all the data of block 191) to process the transactions.",blockchainethereumopcodegethevm,"Mar 21, 2022 at 8:23",,"Add a comment

Background: I tried setting up a web3 instance with useRef, however it only passed null through context. I found though that using useState and not using useEffect worked. Curious about best practice though.
export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {

  /* ⨯ Passed through context as null */
  const web3 = useRef(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (window.ethereum) {
      web3.current = new Web3(window.ethereum)
    }
  }, [])

  /* ✓ Passed through context as web3 instance */
  const [web3, setWeb3] = useState(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (window.ethereum) {
      const w3 = new Web3(window.ethereum)
      setWeb3(w3)
    }
  }, [])

  /* ✓ Passed through context as web3 instance */
  if (window.ethereum) {
    const w3 = new Web3(window.ethereum)
    setWeb3(w3)       // ✓
    web3.current = w3 // ✓
  }

  return (
    <Web3Context.Provider value={web3.current ?? web3}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Web3Context.Provider>
  )

Deposit works fine,  However when I try to withdraw:

    console.log('withdrawTrans:', withdrawTrans.hash);

I get an error:

                You can try to perform the transaction on a public testnet and then use tenderly.io to pin down the source code line where it reverts

It is the same error when I try with Raiden client v1.x.x. I decided to take another look at deploying Raiden contracts with contract-version==0.37.0 after failing to deploy on GETH v1.10.1-stable, reaching out to the dev team and they suggested using v1.9.21-stable, but I get a vague error. which is hard to debug when deploying the TokenNetworkRegistry.sol

I am looking for any way to send bitcoin from one wallet to another wallet on localhost itself, without using network to avoid network fees. For better understanding; look the case as if I have 2 or more bitcoin wallet files with me on my local system which contains all the details of the wallet to access it. Is there any way to transfer bitcoins from one wallet to another offline (without using online network). I tried to create 2 wallet wallet using 

WalletAppKit kit = new WalletAppKit(params, new File(""./wallet""), filePrefix);
kit.startAsync();
kit.awaitRunning();


this created wallet when I used to different filePrefix or I can create it by 

Wallet wallet = new Wallet(params);
wallet.autoSaveFile(true);


Now I have 2 wallets on my machine. I tried to create PeerGroup and tried to connectToLocalhost() but every time its shows (below is the part of log)

                It works fine on external network and deduct transaction fees. Its good to transfer if 2 wallets are at different location with 2 different owners. Here, I am the owner of both the wallets, I don't think I need external network because both the wallets are in my laptop. The network used to transfer data in form bitcoin to transfer bitcoin from one wallet to another.  I am asking, is there any way to transfer bitcoin (using bitcoinj liberary) on local machine if both wallets are at same machine (I have full access of both) without using external network? I hope, now my question is more clear.

  By default, BigchainDB 2.0 creates some MongoDB indexes and the
  BigchainDB HTTP API includes some endpoints for doing basic queries.
  However, as outlined in the previous paragraph, each node operator can
  add additional indexes and query APIs.

Send signed transaction from nodejs to private SmartContract using webjs in Quorum network not working,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53166904/send-signed-transaction-from-nodejs-to-private-smartcontract-using-webjs-in-quor,0,3,1k,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qqay5WBqclc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABRM/m16czKrC2WI/photo.jpg?sz=32,"Nov 6, 2018 at 6:44",97,victor_reiner,https://stackoverflow.com/users/8898671/victor-reiner,Send signed transaction from nodejs to private SmartContract using webjs in Quorum network not working,"4 years, 3 months ago","4 years, 3 months ago","Context

I have a quorum network mounted following the example of 7nodes. In node 1 I have deployed a smart contract privately, putting the public key of this ""BULeR8JyUWhiuuCMU/HLA0Q5pzkYT+cHII3ZKBey3Bo="" in the private form.

My goal is to make a transfer to this smart contract, to execute one of its functions. Being a private contract the transfer has to be signed.

All this from a nodejs server.

Code

The smart contract is the following:

pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

contract SimpleStorage {
  uint storedData;
  uint secondData;
  uint TData;
  function set(uint x) external {
    storedData = x;
  }
  function setSecond(uint x) external {
    secondData = x;
  }
  function setT(uint x) external {
    TData = x;
  }
  function get() external view returns (uint retVal) {
    return storedData;
  }
  function getSecond() external view returns (uint retVal) {
    return secondData;
  }
  function getT() external view returns (uint retVal) {
    return TData;
  }
}


The code in nodejs is the following:

const Web3 = require('web3');
const EthereumTx = require('ethereumjs-tx');
const contract = require('truffle-contract');
const simpleStorageInterface = require(""./contracts/SimpleStorage.json"");
var web3 = new Web3(
    new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://172.10.4.159:22000')
);

Question and problem

The transaction is executed successfully, but the new value ""123"" is not changed in the smart contract. Only if I unlock the account before the transaction await web3.eth.personal.unlockAccount (account, """") works really, but I do not want to be blocking and unblocking the account for security reasons.

A correct transfer would be the following:

{
  blockHash: ""0xe5a2df3f592392c71f9995d697721c046f60c81d2988418b0c7b929cb17a0cee"",

  value: 0
}


The difference is the property ""v"", the value that is being fixed in my transfer is not correct, it has to be 0x25 or 0x26 to identify them as private transfers. I do not understand why these values are not setting well, helpme please.",node.jsblockchainethereumweb3jsquorum,,victor_reiner,"Add a comment

Here is my IrohaConnection.kt file to form a request to send to Iroha server. Basically, I just copy and port from Java to Kotlin from this iroha-android-sample repo. 

This is the message I get from Iroha console:

It's said that:


CommandService Stateless invalid tx
Transaction should contain at least one command
Wrongly formed creator_account_id, passed value: ''
bad timestamp: too old, timestamp: 0, now: 1533693437270
Quorum should be within range (0, 128] ]]


I'm not really understand how Iroha receive variables but when debug I see:



createdTime_ , creatorAccountId_, quorum_ these 3 vars has value which is kind of what Iroha ask for, but somehow the server not get it.

Another weird things is, on the sample Iroha-android repo: build.gradle:

release {
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        resValue ""string"", ""iroha_url"", ""199.247.26.56""
        resValue ""integer"", ""iroha_port"", ""50051""
    }
    debug {
        resValue ""string"", ""iroha_url"", ""199.247.26.56""
        resValue ""integer"", ""iroha_port"", ""50051""
    }


You see those IP? When using this default IP 199.247.26.56, the app work, but when I change to my local IP, which is the same PC - my own Iroha deployment, it's not. I think that on this IP 199.247.26.56, they have deployed Iroha correctly. 

So on that though, I have deploy Iroha following these:


https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html#starting-iroha-node
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/deployment.html#docker
Build from source: https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-api/#docker


But still the same error:


CommandService Stateless invalid tx
Transaction should contain at least one command
Wrongly formed creator_account_id, passed value: ''
bad timestamp: too old, timestamp: 0, now: 1533693437270
Quorum should be within range (0, 128] ]]

I'm working on Woleet Blockchain API to protect intellectual properties (eg. Files, Docs, Images and Videos). I'm using PHP cURL library to make api requests to server. When I used PUT request with cURL it states the following ERROR.

Any help would be appreciated. Here is the link to api Woleet Documentation documentation in case you need to study about it. Because there is no support for this on the documentation so I decided to put it on stackoverflow if anyone had faced a same problem. My current PHP code looks like this.

Network A is having channel 1, 2 and 3.
Network B is having channel 4, 5 and 6. 

Now say channel 3 has many transactions and it's growing at an exponential rate so I decided to separate that channel on a different network. 
Can I possibly move channel 3 to Network B? Or maybe Network C as well which is a fresh n/w. 

The possible options are. 
 1. Replay all the transactions on Network B/C. Somehow I need to capture all the transactions happened on channel C and then replay it. Timestamp of the transactions here would change for sure. 
 2. Copy files from Network A and Create Network C which is exact copy of Network A and then find a way to delete data from Channel 1 and 2. Not sure if this is a clean way. 
 3. Join Network A from Network C as an separate Org in Channel 3 so, all the transactions would sync from network A to network C and then I somehow remove Channel 3 from network A. Not sure if this would work. I wish leaving channel was an option provided. 
 4. I already tried migrating kafka topics/Couchdb data to separate instances and carry on from there, but failed. 

None of the options I mentioned might work so If any one has a better idea please share.",blockchainhyperledger-fabrichyperledger,,Ashish Mishra,"Add a comment

I hope, it matches the idea as expected of Smart Contract and Blockchain 2.0.

Problem

Suppose, I have received a 25 MB file from some one through some media. I would like to have it scanned for virus before I actually open it for use. How can I be sure that it is not infected?

Traditional Solution 

Perhaps there is a cloud based service provided for virus scan - Virus Scanning as a Service (VSaaS). This provider has subscription plans based on file type, volume and frequency of scans. I could approach this provider to scan my file and receive a binary response as TRUE (clean) or FALSE (infected). But, I have no choice but to trust two things of the provider:


Did the provider scan at all? Or, more generally, was 'work' done at all? Maybe, there is a tiny script to return TRUE and FALSE with 50% probability regardless of how many and what type of files are sent.
Was the provider's scan conclusive? Maybe, the provider does not have all of the virus signatures to scan successfully. So, the provider may respond with TRUE (clean) whereas, it is actually infected with the latest strain of a virus.


Smart Contract 

Can a distributed application (or, Smart Contract) resolve this problem? I know that the underlying blockchain provides a publicly available ledger that can verify:


If I have sufficient coins (say, BTC) to cover the scan service request.
If a scan request (the transaction in this case) was made, to whom, when, etc.


What I do not know is, how do I answer the questions that I have for the traditional solution? That is, what is the mechanism to confirm that a virus scan did actually happen in its entirety? Should multiple 'full nodes' do a virus scan of the same file? If so, am I not spreading my ambiguity across multiple full nodes (in effect, different cloud providers in a conventional way) now?

The problem is I haven't found a way to change the header nav bg color and footer bg as well as 80% of the rest of the react ts components.
I've followed multiple tutorials and have been reading up on typescript's styled-component documentation but I haven't been able to find any examples or documentation that is similar to uikit.
The core theme provider code that is used is: pancake-uikit - Here is where all my confusion lies and where I haven't been able to find any documentation for this type of theme setup.
If you visit the uikit repository , you can see all of the core styled-components related code.
Actually I'm less familiar with typescript and styled components.

Thx",blockchaininternet-computerdfinity,,Lupexlol,"Generally data on chain is ""public"", however you can encrypt the data so that the public cannot read it.  Can you share something about your use case?  Perhaps a solution will become evident.  ""Public"" in this case means that node providers with technical chops could access the data, so the privacy is similar to that you would get if you hired a machine from a cloud provider.  Node providers have a financial disincentive to be naughty but if they are prepared to take the hit they could hack into the data on their own server.

When that is done, I guess you could consider data to be pretty secure, although I'd still encrypt if your secret is worth a billion dollars.

in this context I have to get a list of details from another contract.
here are the details :
I have contract JobOffer which have a list of candidacy ( mapping(uint256 => address[]) idJobAddressCandidat;   ) unit256 present the id of candidacy and those addresses are the addresses of candidate.
the whole information of candidate is stocked by another contract called contract CVStorage
this contract have a function which returns all the informations :
function getAllDetails(address _addressCandidat)
        public
        view
        returns (CV memory)
    {
        return CVs[_addressCandidat];

the problem is: I want to get the list of details for each address linked to an id of candidacy in the mapping ( returning a list of details of candidates in a candidacy) ; the signature of the function i want to develop is :
getAllCandidaturesOfJobOffer(uint256 _idJobOffer) public view returns ( CV [] memory )
PS : I tried to get all those information from the front end (React) by getting the array of addresses of a candidacy using this function :
function getAllCandidaturesOfJobOffer(uint256 _idJobOffer)
        public
        view
        returns (address[] memory)
    {
        return idJobAddressCandidat[_idJobOffer];
    }

and then i get for each address the data from the other CVStorage contract ( using the function getAllDetails(address _addressCandidat)  but unfortunately i got usually an error maybe because I shouldn't call two contracts in the same function or two await methods in the same function.
thanks for giving me your time.",blockchainethereumsoliditysmartcontracts,,Ameny Bouzid,"You could make getAllDetails() external so that you can call it from within the second contract.  Otherwise your second contract should import your first contract so that you can use those methods from within the second contract.

However, on https://polygonscan.com/gastracker we see a base fee equal to 0. Same on https://polygonscan.com/blocks.
Request on eth_feeHistory:
{'jsonrpc': '2.0', 'id': 0, 'result': {'baseFeePerGas': ['0x73', '0x6c', '0x64', '0x5e', '0x5b'], 'gasUsedRatio': [0.2267586, 0.2028314, 0.2325742, 0.3555376], 'oldestBlock': '0x17cc92e', 'reward': [['0x9502f8f8d', '0x9502f8f8d', '0x2ea19dccfc'], ['0x89d5f3011', '0x9502f9000', '0xba43b7394'], ['0x9502f9000', '0xba43b739c', '0x19d81d959c'], ['0x89d5f2ed7', '0x8d8f9fb82', '0xcce4165a2']]}}

We see that the base fee is equal to [115, 108, 100, 94, 91]. It's on infura.
But local node returns 22 Wei as the base fee for the next block.
What is the real base fee on polygon chain, zero or not? If not zero, why the base fee is so small, like 90 Wei? And why does a local node always return 22 Wei as the base fee?
UPDATE:
Ok, now I see that the base fee will appear on the Polygonscan. But the question remains why a local node can return 22 Wei?",blockchainethereumweb3py,"May 23, 2022 at 14:00",TylerH,"Add a comment

I have deployed the contract and have put down my contract code below.
The problem I am facing is I get the below error when I call getMyToken function from my frontend web3js code.
{code: -32603, message: 'execution reverted: ERC1155: caller is not owner nor approved', data: {…}}

Not sure what is happening. I am calling the function as below from frontend. The isApproved function is returning true.
const selectedAccountIsApproved = await monkeysContract.methods.isApproved(selectedAccount).call();
console.log('IS APPROVED RESULT: ', selectedAccountIsApproved);
if(selectedAccountIsApproved) {
    const result = await monkeysContract.methods.mintMyMonkey(selectedAccount, 0).call();
    console.log('Transfer Result: ', result);
} else {
    console.log('Account not approved by owner for transfers');
}

NOTE:

I have called the setApprovalForAll method and approved the receiver account.
I am able to call isApprovedForAll and verify that the account is approved.
I am able to transfer tokens to the receiver through Etherscan contract interface.

my users also can switch between the networks, so I'd like to update web3's provider based on a user's choice
so this is what I am doing to have such a functionality:
const getLibrary = useCallback(() => {

 switch (web3Provider.selectedProvider) {

    provider = Web3.givenProvider

  default:
    provider = Web3.givenProvider
    break
 }

 return new Web3(provider)
}, [web3Provider])

looks like it has to work properly, but when I am trying to get any token's data via web3React.library.eth.Contract, etc.

There is a docker-compose which launches Kusama network with some minor changes (like epoch time and proposal voting/enacting time) with custom chain-spec for 6 validators, and it runs with 2 collator nodes of moonbeam (default moonbeam-local chain-spec, where Alice and Bob addresses replaced with custom ones).
I successfully launch the parachain on relay chain, and it produces blocks (besides, it triggers something like ""Skipping because we are not eligible"", not sure if it is ok, but still, the blocks are being produced). Btw, I've manually set all the session keys for the validators and collators, sending the RPC calls (for the collators it's only nmbs???). I can connect to metamask,
I can query some info through RPC, etc. But the problem is that I cannot send any transactions, it all fails with the following error:
ValueError: {'code': -32603, 'message': 'submit transaction to pool failed: Pool(InvalidTransaction(InvalidTransaction::Call))'}.
The same transation works on moonbase testnet, and it also works with --dev collator. What could be the issue? Thank you in advance

To do that I followed the avalances github documentation as in the link,
https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-faucet
In short, basically, I run my 5 nodes and all nodes runs successfully using an Ubuntu Sandbox. Also, the bootstrap is finished. Then tried to run the below command in the Ubuntu,
Platform Versions: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
node-js v16.2.0
npm 7.15.0
Yarn 1.22.5
Creating Faucet:

Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-faucet.git
Go to the root directory cd avalanche-faucet
Install javascript dependencies with yarn install.
Create a .env file by copying .env.example
Install AvalancheGo, our Avalanche node client written in Golang to spin up a network (https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego).

Running Project:

Make sure you have installed and able to run an Avalanche node properly.
All environment variables are correct and your private key has funds in it.
Run the project with hot reloading yarn serve

Everything is goes ok but when I run yarn serve then the below Error pop up. ""Assertion `thread_id_key != 0x7777' failed.""

                We tried the steps from the AVA faucet. Tried it on Ubuntu server and it is working fine. Though it needs node and npm to be installed instead of yarn. Hope it works for you too :-)

Further more I’m using Mac OS Catalina version 10.15 (19A583).
Steps to reproduce the error:

clone the repo into a directory

install go version 1.7, npm and node.js

open terminal >> navigate to geth file and run make geth and after installing all the packages, run geth --testnet --cache=512 console to see if geth is responding and showing transactions on the ledger.

Navigate back to the Dapp file and run npm build, then  navigate back again to ""Geth""
And run the following command as mentioned in the repo
build/bin/geth --datadir  /path/to/Blockchain/Blockchain --mine --port 30301 --rpcport 8545 --networkid 1234 -- nodiscover --unlock 0 --password pas.txt --rpc --rpccorsdomain '*' -- rpcapi=""db,eth,net,web3,personal,web3,miner"" 


I get the following error :
Fatal: Failed to create the protocol stack: mkdir /path: read-only file system

After changing the directory name ""/path/to/Blockchain/Blockchain"" to my project working directoy I have managed to bypass the fatal error shown above. However when I navigate back to Dapp file to rund the command  node server.js to run the UI on localhost:3003 i get the following error:

I want each transaction detail to to appear in a new TableView ViewController in a new column for each transaction with Provider Destinator and Amount, and have a description of the transaction code by clicking on the transaction in each column.
I was able to create a onTapButton, to create a new transaction and hash it in SHA256, and output it as JSON. Now what I'm trying to do is just send the transaction info in each column, I'm still scratching my head on how to do that. Here is some of the source code without going into too much details:
Transaction (App.swift)
class Transaction : Codable {
    
    var from: String
    var to: String
    var amount: Double
}

JSON Encoder (App.swift)
var key: String {
    get {
        let transactionsData = try! JSONEncoder().encode(self.transactions)
        let transactionsJSONString = String(data: transactionsData, encoding: .utf8)
        
        return String(self.index) + self.previousHash + String(self.nonce) + transactionsJSONString!
    }
}

onTapButton (ViewController.swift)
@IBAction func onTapSendButton(_ sender: UIButton) {
        
    self.generateDummyTransactions()
    let str:String = ""Mary""
    self.providerForm.text = str
    let str2:String = ""Bob""
    self.destinatorForm.text = str2
    //let int:Double = 20.0
    //self.amountSum = int   
}

print function (ViewController.swift)
func generateDummyTransactions() {
            
    _ = self.providerForm
    _ = self.destinatorForm
    _ = self.amountSum
            
    let transaction = Transaction(from: ""Mary"", to: ""Bob"", amount: 20, transactionType: TransactionType.domestic)
    let block1 = Block()
    block1.addTransaction(transaction: transaction)
            
    let transaction2 = Transaction(from: ""Phil"", to: ""Gab"", amount: 10.0, transactionType: .domestic)
    block1.addTransaction(transaction: transaction2)
    print(""------------------------------------------------------"")
    let block = blockchain.getNextBlock(transactions: [transaction])
    blockchain.addBlock(block)
            
    // print(blockchain.blocks.count)
    let data = try! JSONEncoder().encode(blockchain)
    let blockchainJSON = String(data : data, encoding: .utf8)
            
    print(blockchainJSON!)
            
    realTimeTextOutput.text = blockchainJSON
}

Here is how I want it to look in the second ViewController for the TableView:

                You can use jmeter to send any number of transactions in a second to hit apis.

I am using Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.2 (chime), with the poet algorithm, with influxdb, and graphana. I created a script to evaluate the CPU and RAM consumption on the server, and observe the result in the image CPU and RAM consumption.


In addition, I took the system analyzed with the HTOP tool, and even the SWAP was fully consumed, as illustrated in this figure that shows the consumption moments before the error occurred.


In the Faq (https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/faq/validator/) of doubts, I found the following statement:

  /var/lib/Sawtooth/block-00.lmdb . The LMDB database is a ""sparse"" file
  meaning no storage is allocated for the file until it is used (written
  to). The database should not run out of memory, as long as filesystem
  storage is available. The memory error could happen in Kubernetes or
  Docker or other virtual machine environments where there are no
  storage volumes mapped to the VM.


Since I am running my three validators in docker containers on the same server machine, I imagine the problem is that transactions are not being stored on disk but remain in RAM because of LMDB.

How to solve this problem?",dockerout-of-memoryblockchainlmdbhyperledger-sawtooth,"Dec 23, 2019 at 14:03",,"It does not appear to be error because your RAM is occupied completely. Even if your RAM is occupied completely, your processing should slow down with increased disk IO. It's an error in FFI layer. Do you have more log traces? And which version of Sawtooth are you running? You may run system diagnostic command to see remaining RAM space in the containers. Enabling Graphana will come handy.

Consequently, Azure has created a different tenant where all users will be managed.

We also have setup a Blockchain app, which can be done only in AD tenant (not in AD B2C). Now, we would like users in B2C to interact with the blockchain API. This cannot be done as only users in AD are allowed.

Is there a way to link users in B2C to AD? Other solution?",azureblockchainazure-blockchain-workbench,"Sep 16, 2019 at 9:28",StuartLC,"When you say you want external users to interact with the blockchain API, do you mean the REST API, or the ABW interactive UI? Deeper into ABW, every 'user' issuing transactions needs to be mapped to an Ethereum/Quorum Address, so you would still either need to create a user account (e.g. via the ABW UI or the REST API) for each user (UserChainMapping). If you build your own API, then you could use a centralized ABW user and track the calling user yourself.

                AFAIK the RESTapi requires AD. What you could do is use the messaging API via Azure Service Bus - it requires only Endpoint security (not user level authentication), however you will need to do the UserChainIdentifier mappings between your B2C users and their ABW UserId

                Many thanks for your input. Seems there is no solution... We are going to use the 'invite API' so users are registered straight in AD. And subsequently avoid B2C.  Not ideal as we are not too sure how the UI can be customised. Also would you know what is the limit for number of users in AD?

Inorder to resolve this, I figured that I would have to overide the default timeout configurations in fabric. SO, I made changes to the deafault.jsonconfig file inside the fabric-client node module.I increased the values inside the keys of ""request-timeout"",""grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms"", ""grpc-wait-for-ready-timeout"" but my applicationstill times out in like ~30-35 seconds. I also changes the timeout parameter value in the connection-org1.yamlfile but the application still times out at the same time.

How do I increase this timeout time to allow the heavy computation inside my chaincode? I know that my chaincode and fabric installations are correct because because the same applciationa and chaincode runs finein a system with better resources(i.e the computation takes ~15 seconds in faster computer)",hyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledgergrpchyperledger-fabric-sdk-js,,Akshay Mathew,"info you need is in this post stackoverflow.com/questions/51503153/…

                It's the right value to change to increase it from the default 30 second timeout, so maybe the value you are supplying is incorrect assuming you have restarted everything by removing all existing containers.

Suppose I have a function ADD written in C language that adds two integers int A and int B and returns the sum C. 
Now, I want to verify that my function ADD worked correctly using the Ethereum blockchain.

To do so, I deployed a simple smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain that has a function called Verify ((A,B),C) that returns true if verification holds, false otherwise. 
For this verification, I want to pass two parameters to the Verify function. The first parameter should be the inputs and the second parameter will be the output of my ADD function.

The Verify function will be executed on (A,B), generate output C' and compare it with C. If C'== C, return true, else return false. 
Now, for the above example, my question is following:


How to translate the compiled binary code of my C program to EVM code? In other words, if I consider (A,B,0) as state 1 output and (A,B,C) as state 2 output of my program in C, then how can I convert each state to EVM bytecode so that, EVM start execution from state1 and ends at state2?",blockchainethereumbytecodesmartcontractsevm,"Jul 28, 2019 at 1:01",,"Add a comment

Problem connecting web3 via websocket to node with nginx,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56524509/problem-connecting-web3-via-websocket-to-node-with-nginx,0,2,1k,https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_4OVQtO9bj8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/_yuGscmj1o8/photo.jpg?sz=32,"Jun 10, 2019 at 10:21",21,Álvaro Gómez,https://stackoverflow.com/users/11625087/%c3%81lvaro-g%c3%b3mez,Problem connecting web3 via websocket to node with nginx,"3 years, 8 months ago",20 days ago,"We are trying to connect to a geth node via WebSockets to be able to subscribe to contract events. This node is created with docker and this docker uses nginx as a proxy.
We can connect easily with HTTP (not WS rpc), but we cannot subscribe to contract events with HTTP.
We have managed to establish the connection in a local instance of this docker image with a node.js websocket server with this same nginx proxy. But we cannot connect with web3 v1.0.0-beta55.
The 2 different error we get are 403 (Forbidden) with this nginx config (which is the one that works with non web3 web sockets):
location /rpcws {
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection ""upgrade"";
    proxy_pass http://localhost:22001;
}

or error 400 (bad request) with this other configuration:
location /rpcws {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:22001;
}

On the client side we get either

Error during WebSocket handshake: Unexpected response code: 400||403

or

connection not open on send()

Right now we are tracking possible port issues, in a local instance of this docker image, but we have configured several times the node to receive this ws connection through the already working http rpc port (Obviously changing all the geth and nginx config to receive wsrpc and not http rpc) and we get the same error codes.
Our main guess is that nginx is not proxy_passing correctly the WebSocket request. We asked the quorum network technical team and they have never tried to establish a WebSocket connection, and they don't know how to help us any further.
All the code is listed below.

   }

       fName = _fName;
       age = _age;

Now Org2 wants to access some predefined data-points form Org1's L1. 

What should be my system architecture to make sure that Org2 accesses only the predefined data-points and the whole of L1 remains completely invisible.

Both, Org1 and Org2 have their separate sets of operations which should be invisible to another organization.

                Well, I would use private collection feature to let organizations store their sensitive data. And keep only those data in the ledger which would be relevant to complete transactions or can be shared among organization. Private collections would help, and reduce the number of channels you might require.

                You should not worry about that. That's why we have private collection and private collection configuration where you mention the organizations who should have access to private collections. For every set of organizations you would be creating that many set of private collections and configurations. I would highly recommend that you go through the documentation for more clarity and better understanding. hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/…

There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoin, and they’re released at a rate that gets cut in half every four years or so. Roughly 19,000,000 already exist, so there are only 2,000,000 more to be released over the next 120 years.


What about Ethereum? The circulating supply is around 118,000,000, and there’s no cap on how many Ether can exist. But Ethereum’s net emissions were recently adjusted via a burn mechanism so that it would reach a stable supply, or potentially even be deflationary, resulting in somewhere between 100-120m tokens total. Given that, we shouldn’t expect much inflationary pressure on Ether either. It could even be deflationary.


Dogecoin has no supply cap either, and it is currently inflating at around 5% per year. So of the three, we should expect inflationary tokenomics to erode the value of Doge more than Bitcoin or Ethereum.


The last thing you want to consider with supply is allocation. Do a few investors hold a ton of the tokens which are going to be unlocked soon? Did the protocol give most of its tokens to the community? How fair does the distribution seem? If a bunch of investors have 25% of the supply and those tokens will unlock in a month, you might hesitate before buying in.",apiblockchainethereum,,Let Me Tink About It,"I feel this is not a programming question, but a product design question. I suggest your best bet is to sticking to someone else's API who already is doing this.

I have a AdminWallet that has all the nft's in it.
Now I want users to be able to claim them with a press of a button.
I am using js code to accomplish this.
I have the following code:
    const tx = {
        from: PUBLIC_KEY,
        to: user_address,
        nonce: nonce,
        gas: 500000,
        data: contract.methods.safeTransferFrom(PUBLIC_KEY, user_address, ""1"").encodeABI(),
        chain: ""rinkeby"",
        hardfork: ""petersburg""
    }

    const signPromise = web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(tx, PRIVATE_KEY)
    signPromise
        .then((signedTx) => {
            web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
                signedTx.rawTransaction,
                function(err, hash) {
                    if (!err) {
                        console.log(
                            ""The hash of your transaction is: "",
                            hash,
                        )
                    } else {
                        console.log(
                            ""Something went wrong when submitting your transaction:"",
                            err
                        )
                    }
                }
            )
        })
        .catch((err) => {
            console.log("" Promise failed:"", err)
        }) 

So what I am trying to do here is send an nft with tokenid '1' from the 'AdminWallet' on the address of PUBLIC_KEY to the user_address.
If I would do it without the signtransaction(), I would call the following:
contract.methods.safeTransferFrom(PUBLIC_KEY, user_address, ""1"").send({ from: PUBLIC_KEY})
From what I could find the signTransaction() calls the .Call() of the tx data.
If I want to transfer the nft with my original way I have to call the .send() function.
Is there anyway to call the .send() function to sign the automatically sign the transaction?",javascriptblockchainweb3jsnft,"May 4, 2022 at 21:48",TylerH,"Add a comment

ransactions are a formal action on a blockchain. They are always initiated in MetaMask with a call to the eth_sendTransaction method. They can involve a simple sending of ether, may result in sending tokens, creating a new smart contract, or changing state on the blockchain in any number of ways. They are always initiated by a signature from an external account, or a simple key pair.

There are two type of dockerfile - docker-compose.yml and docker-compose-installed.yaml. I installed the first one with docker-compose and there was no problem. However, when I tried to install the latter one I keep getting the error:

I tried several methods by searching the internet but no luck so far. I also tried to install with root (sudo -i) but still it doesn't work at all.
Another thing is I don't know the second docker-file is mandatory for installation as there is no document or guidance provided by the author.

The repo can be found here: https://github.com/zmitton/eth-proof
The method async txAgainstBlockHash(txHash, blockHash){} initially fails when comparing the trusted blockhash provided to the block hash derived from the header retrieved from an RPC request.
The code that provides this header can be found here:
https://github.com/zmitton/eth-object/blob/c11283243bb0745c52a8827b1b72e86b826aa094/src/header.js

    if(rpcResult){
      return new this([
        toBuffer(rpcResult.parentHash),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.sha3Uncles) || KECCAK256_RLP_ARRAY,
        toBuffer(rpcResult.miner),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.stateRoot) || KECCAK256_NULL,

        toBuffer(rpcResult.nonce)

    }else{
      return new this()

          toBuffer(rpcResult.number),
          toBuffer(rpcResult.gasLimit),
          toBuffer(rpcResult.gasUsed),

        ]);
      }
    }else{
      return new this()
    }
  }

The next stage that fails is when the method tries to derive the root for the transactions trie, for which I was unsuccessful in updating the method responsible for returning the serialized fields.
The source of this can be found here https://github.com/zmitton/eth-object/blob/master/src/transaction.js and the method responsible looks like this:
 static fromRpc(rpcResult){
    return new Transaction([
      toBuffer(rpcResult.nonce),
      toBuffer(rpcResult.gasPrice),
      toBuffer(rpcResult.gas || rpcResult.gasLimit),
      toBuffer(rpcResult.to),
      toBuffer(rpcResult.value),
      toBuffer(rpcResult.input || rpcResult.data),
      toBuffer(rpcResult.v),
      toBuffer(rpcResult.r),
      toBuffer(rpcResult.s)
    ])
  }

My attempts looked something like this:
 static fromRpc(rpcResult){
    if(rpcResult.type && rpcResult.type === '0x2') {
      return new Transaction([
        toBuffer(rpcResult.chainId),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.nonce),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.maxPriorityFeePerGas),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.maxFeePerGas),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.gas || rpcResult.gasLimit),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.to),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.value),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.input || rpcResult.data),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.accessList),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.v),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.r),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.s)
      ]);
    } else {
      return new Transaction([
        toBuffer(rpcResult.nonce),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.gasPrice),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.gas || rpcResult.gasLimit),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.to),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.value),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.input || rpcResult.data),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.v),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.r),
        toBuffer(rpcResult.s)
      ]);
    }

Concretely, I am developing a Dapp on blockchain, where users have to give their personal information for specific purposes. Now what I am missing is a technology to store such sensitive data in a way that users can trust me I'm not using their information for other purposes. This will work if data is stored on a decentralized storage that can interact with smartcontract, in addition, whenever users make a request, my smartcontract should be able to retrieve data from the storage (as an API). This article shows 7 decentralized data storage networks that seem to work on my Dapp. But I'm a programmer and relatively new to blockchain so I don't really know which one is the best suit for my purposes and can be easily scaled up when more and more users enter. I'd like to hear your opinions, especially from those who worked/ is working on a similar projects to mine. Also, it would be great if someone can give me any application has been released that using such technology to store sensitive data. So far, I don't see any such application.

Basically the user is able to upload a certificate, and the certificate will be hashed and the hash is stored on the blockchain.
JavaScript Code:
captureFile = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    //Process file for IPFS
    const file = event.target.files[0]
    const reader = new window.FileReader()
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file)
    reader.onloadend = () => {
      this.setState({buffer: Buffer(reader.result) })
    }
  }

onSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    console.log(""submitting the form..."")
    ipfs.add(this.state.buffer, (error, result) => {
      console.log('ipfs result', result)
      const certificateHash = result[0].hash
      if (error) {
        console.error(error)
        return
      }
      this.state.contract.methods.set(certificateHash).send({ from: this.state.account }).then((r) => {
        this.setState({ certificateHash })
      })
    })
  }

Smart contract code:
pragma solidity >=0.4.21 <0.6.0;

contract Certificate {
    string certificateHash;

    //write function
    function set(string memory _certificateHash) public {
        certificateHash = _certificateHash;
    }

    //read fucntion
    function get() public view returns (string memory){
        return certificateHash;
    }

}

For testing, I am using Truffle and Ganache. Up until this part, everything is fine. Whenever I upload the file, it is successfully detected by metamask and I am able to confirm the transaction. So I've decided to add 1 more step - Encrypting the file before uploading it into the block chain. I added the following code:
New JS file for encryption methods
const CryptoJS = require(""crypto-js"");

const passKeyword = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);
const passFile = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);
const salt = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);
const iv = CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.random(16);

const keywordKey = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(passKeyword, salt, {
    keySize: 256 / 32
});

const fileKey = CryptoJS.PBKDF2(passFile, salt, {
    keySize: 256 / 32
})

var cryptoMethods = {

    fileEncryption: function (fileBuffer) {

        var toEncFile = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(fileBuffer);
        var encryptedFile = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(toEncFile, fileKey, {
            iv: iv, //offset
            mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, //encryption mode
            padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7 //padding mode
        })

        var convEncFile = CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(encryptedFile)
        return cryptoMethods.convertWordArrayToUint8Array(convEncFile);
    },

    //Not yet tested
    fileDecryption: function (fileCipher) {

        var ciphertextStr = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.parse(fileCipher);
        var toDecFile = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify (ciphertextStr);
        var decryptedFile = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt (toDecFile, fileKey, {
            iv: iv, //offset
            mode: CryptoJS.mode.CBC, //encryption mode
            padding: CryptoJS.pad.Pkcs7 //padding mode
        });

        var decryptedFileString = decryptedFile.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
        return decryptedFileString.toString();
    },

    convertWordArrayToUint8Array: function (wordArray) {
        var len = wordArray.words.length,
            u8_array = new Uint8Array(len << 2),
            offset = 0, word, i
        ;
        for (i=0; i<len; i++) {
            word = wordArray.words[i];
            u8_array[offset++] = word >> 24;
            u8_array[offset++] = (word >> 16) & 0xff;
            u8_array[offset++] = (word >> 8) & 0xff;
            u8_array[offset++] = word & 0xff;
        }
        return u8_array;
    },
}

export default cryptoMethods;

Main App.js file:
captureFile = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    //Process file for IPFS
    const file = event.target.files[0]
    const reader = new window.FileReader()
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file)
    reader.onloadend = () => {
      this.setState({buffer: Buffer(reader.result) })
    }
  }

onSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    console.log(""submitting the form..."")

    var encFile = cryptographicMod.fileEncryption(this.state.buffer);
    var convEncFile = new Uint8Array([])
        convEncFile = toBuffer(encFile)
        console.log(convEncFile)

    ipfs.add(convEncFile, (error, result) => {
      console.log('ipfs result', result)
      const certificateHash = result[0].hash
      if (error) {
        console.error(error)
        return
      }

if (this.state.contract) {
                this.state.contract.methods.set(certificateHash)
                    .send({from: this.state.account}).then((r) => {
                    this.setState({certificateHash})

                    window.alert('File submitted')
                })
            } else {
                console.log('Contract state is empty')
            }

    })
  }

After implementing the new code and trying to upload a file in the application, I get the following error:

I have been following this tutorial: https://github.com/MIT-PAC/droidsafe-src/wiki/Requirements . According to this tutorial I needed to download Java, Eclipse, SDK plugins, etc. Everything worked out fine, (In the 2nd step, to set the root of eclipse installation, I have set it to:
target.eclipse.platform=/home/risvy_rim/Downloads/adt-bundle-linux-x86_64-20140321/eclipse
hope it was okay.

until I reached step 3 of this page:

(solution can be any kind of smart chain netwrok, but if it is for Binance smart chain, then it will be better)",blockchainsmartcontractsbinance,,Gizmo,"Add a comment

I am trying to develop APIs in ExpressJS that will interact with Smart Contracts using EtherJS. While at the frontend, I have integrated Sequence Wallet and will call the relevant APIs as the need arises.
But I am running into some problems, like when creating a transaction or minting an NFT, we need to get the signer from the wallet. So as my smart contracts are linked to the Backend, and the wallet is linked to the frontend, how can I sign the transactions at the Backend?
I am currently planning to somehow transfer the signer to the Backend and sign the transaction there.
I would really appreciate any insight here. My experience as a blockchain developer is very new, but I am a seasoned full-stack developer.",blockchainmernsmartcontractsnftethers.js,,Z3T4 Z00K,"Add a comment

                Why do you need whole folder? Add min dependencies not all, unused contracts from  3'rd part lib

                Because when you add never used contracts to your project codebase, like whole folder from external project/lib, you are polluting your codebase. And that's action is usually unwanted and not a good practice.

My estimates show it's approximately 68,000 rows. However I'm really struggling to get anything meaningful.
Ideally I want to extract to JSON and then import that into Excel so I can start mucking around with the data. However the best I can do is get a count of the transactions, but I want them laid out like this:
Date | Time | TxHash | Sender | Amount | BNBValue
query MyQuery {
  ethereum(network: bsc) {
    smartContractCalls(
      options: {limit: 10}

the transaction that failed
the analysis of the failed transaction in Tenderly

As you can see, I call the swap method of the smart contract with a value of 1 BNB. This method:

receives 1 BNB.
deposits the 1 BNB into the WBNB contract. At this moment, 1 WBNB lies in the proxy.
withdraws the 1 WBNB. At this moment, 1 BNB lies in the proxy.
sends the 1 BNB back to the user.

The transaction seems to fail at the end of step 3.
Moreover, if I directly call the implementation contract, it works.

Let's imagine that any of cryptowallet's is a just function that have only one argument - mnemonic phrase like 12/24 words. I can get new mnemonic on a blockchain.com and paste in, for example, in Binance's Trust - and after that all of them will correctly count my balance.
Referring to some BIP's which are saying much info about derivation pathes - them are just human readable string like m/0/0/0/1, where '1' is id of, for example, bitcoin address.
m/44h/0h/0h/0/0: 1AZnveys2k5taGCCF743RtrWGwc58UMeq

m/44h/0h/0h/0/3: 1L44VTYEzWesp8cxnXcPGbUzuwTYoSW9at

How in this situation another wallet should know how much of indexes I used in first wallet to count all balance from all addresses? Is it real that they are just counting all indexes from first to last?
P.S. talking exactly about b-n.com and Trust - they are using different ""accounts"" (last '0h' in the DP) so if I have some coins on b-n.com I won't see them in Trust.

And they also want to deploy the frontend application on the block chain.

Questioning my own research, is there a specific architectural pattern using smart contracts to build an ecommerce application on the ether block chain?

The problem I got is if a get several requests to add to the chain in a short timeframe I would have two request picking up the same precedingHash before insert Is done and then generat the wrong sequence.
Would I like to do is:

Lock Collection

Insert new document.

The hacker was able to see the decision on whether it was a rare or regular and cancel the mint before it happened.  This is the code:
uint256 tokenId = totalSupply();

        // Getting random number
        uint256 rand = getRandom(tokenId);

        // Store transaction datas
        TransactionData memory transaction = TransactionData(
            _minter,
            block.timestamp,
            _amount
        );
        transactions.push(transaction);
        transactionsForAddress[_minter].push(transaction);

        uint256 typeId = getRandomType(rand);
        uint256 level = gen1
            ? typeId == 0 ? _regular : _rare
            : 1;

        // Store NFT Metadata
        nfts.push(NFT(tokenId, typeId, level));

        _safeMint(_minter, tokenId);

        emit TokenMinted(_minter, tokenId);
    }

How is this possible?  Is it because the mint is done after the decision in another function?
If so does that mean each function is executed in separate blocks?
I am currently working on one and do not wish to make the same mistake

Asked for the random functions:
function getRandom(uint256 _seed) internal view returns (uint256) {

                you shouldn't generate random numbers on-chain, instead, use an oracle to generate your random number to prevent cheating :)

Is it because the file system where data is stored is a distributed file system such as HDFS, rather than using easure coding directly from Hyperledger fabric?
If not, does the Hyperledger fabric use its own easure coding to store transaction data, ledger, etc.? Then, where can I find the relevant information?

The file I am working in is called Airdrop.js.  The code is below.
There is a function called countdown() where I want to make a call to another file called issue-tokens.js that is in a directory two levels up. When the counter in the countdown() function hits zero I want to call this issue-tokens.js file or the function in it...whichever one I can get to work.  The issue-tokens.js code is below Airdrop.js at the bottom of this page for your reference. I hope what i'm asking is somewhat clear. It's odd because I can call the issue-tokens.js file no problem from the command line using truffle exec scripts/issue-tokens.js, but no luck importing it.  Thank you!

                Hello there thanks for responding! I tried to import issue-tokens.js at the top of Airdrop.js file by adding the line: import issueTokens from '../../scripts/issue-tokens';                     This gave me the following error when I try to launch the webpage with npm start from the command line: ./src/components/Airdrop.js Module not found: You attempted to import ../../scripts/issue-tokens which falls outside of the project src/ directory. Relative imports outside of src/ are not supported.

                Assuming I eventually get the import right, I'm not even sure the best way to call the function in the body of the code. Should I just do issueTokens() or would it be better to do something like let rewardTime = issueTokens().  Thanks again for the help!

                The error message you get explains it all: the issue-tokens.js file is outside of allowed import paths your app enforced. So bring that file somewhere inside src/ directory and see what you get. As for calling the exported function: you can call it the same way you call any regular function in ""any"" programming language, there's no specialty in it.

                I tried to bring it one directory down and now I am getting a different error message. I get the following: Attempted import error: '../issue-tokens' does not contain a default export (imported as 'issueTokens'). That's odd because the file definitely has an export in it.  I start the function like this: module.exports = async function issueRewards() {

                @JacobCreech ideally, I would like a similar method like getAccounts where programId is not a required parameter. but I know it's unrealistic. I downloaded network snapshots but there is raw block data. maybe there is a way to get the binary data of all addresses in file format?

A simplified version:
contract Master{
constructor() {}
event AgreementCalled(address[] indexed initialParticipants);
function createAgreement(address[] memory initialParticipants) external {
    emit AgreementCalled (initialParticipants);
    }
}

called from Javascript with web3
let contractTransaction =  await MasterContract.methods.createAgreement([""0x26..7b"", ""0xeA8..A3e"" ])
          .send({from:currentAccount});

I get the following console error
MetaMask - RPC Error: [ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC '{""value"":{""code"":-32603,""data"":{""message"":""VM Exception while processing transaction: revert"",""code"":-32000,""data"":{""0x680b1ed2c6c24f5150a4fa5d1c764d134d25ab122e14891a2348087e6e7eb51e"":{""error"":""revert"",""program_counter"":81,""return"":""0x""},

Interestingly enough, Ganache UI shows the transaction, including the array


If I remove the parameter (an array of addresses) it works fine, like so: MasterContract.methods.createAgreement().send({from:currentAccount});
If I change the array with a simple string both in the contract and javascript, I get the same error.
Adding lots of gas, like .send({from:this.eth.currentAccount, gas: 10000000}) doesn't solve it
Using Web3 1.7.0, solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0, Ganache
From Remix it works just fine

Any idea on what can be going on?",blockchainethereumweb3jsganache,"Jul 29, 2022 at 20:18",TylerH,"Can you share the ABI that you're passing to the web3 instance? Just the createAgreement part is sufficient. It might have an outdated value from earlier development stage, not corresponding with the actual deployed contract... Also, can you check that the addresses are valid? Correct length (""0x"" plus 40 characters), only hex characters?

Yes, I shortened the addresses, but they are okay : [""0xB031c45eC644936126da68104470380c88145633"", ""0xc1243460b4c1648Bdf65c8fDf15d7f031777EC8D""].

I'm just starting with the Solana contract interacting (I have experiences with EVM) and I'm now struggling with how to call custom foreign programs. Is there any way how to obtain existing programs methods/types in a similar way like in EVM and ABI?
For example, when I would like to transfer token directly with web3.TransactionInstruction() instead of splToken.Token.createTransferInstruction(), is there any way how to get params/types directly from the program on blockchain without having external documentation?
I would like to automatize some contracts but I don't have docs for them.
I tried connection.getTransaction() to get existing transactions but there are no types and BufferLayout information. I also tried all SolScanners etc but also I didn't find any info about param names and types.
Is there any way how to do that in Solana? Thanks",blockchainsolanaevm,,Ludek Vodicka,"There is currently no way to get the possible instructions and expected instruction data from an onchain program.  You'll need the source code.

                Hello Frank, thanks a lot for your comment. I already discussed it also on Solana forums and you're unfortunately right. The only chance is to analyze existing transactions and try to replicate them.

                Usually other questions tagged Ethereum here at StackOverflow are more about smart contract source code - in languages like Solidity, Yul, Vyper - and algorithms related to smart contracts... From my point of view, this question is more about the Ethereum network architecture rather than code. So I'm assuming that answerers here (including me) don't have that deep knowledge of this subtopic and won't be able to provide good answers. That's why I linked the StackExchange - there you might get answers from people who are more focused on the topic you're asking about.

What happens to what comes after it?
I get the whole concept of proof-of-work and the hash of both the block itself and the previous one. Mainly, what I don't quite get is once it is proven that a certain block was altered and tampered with due to it no longer connecting to the chain, what happens to the rest that comes after this block?
I know there are two main scenarios that are possible:

The block tampered with is the newest block;
The tampered block is in the middle of the chain;

If it's the newest block, wouldn't the ones that come after it actually approve that information and the data inside the tampered one pass since the hash of the previous block would actually be the one from the tampered? And what if the tampering happened after that block is already on the chain? Would the whole system just cracks and that copy of the blockchain be unconsidered?
Because blockchains work as a system where there's not only one ledger, but several, I get that a block to be added has to pass through a rigorous proof-of-work procedure and if you temper with a block in the middle of the chain, even though you succeeded to mine all following blocks again it still wouldn't work because the several other ledgers will say that this action is not legitimate. Hence, I ask again; where does this block go? Does it just disappear?
Moreover, what stops me from creating a block with fake information, let's suppose that it says I received 5 BTC and I crack the proof-of-work and succeed in finding a nonce that works; how does the system later understand that the information I provided is fake since I'd broadcast to all ledgers that I cracked the nonce and my block is added to the chain?
I'd love it if someone could go over this, it would really help me a lot.",hashcryptographyblockchainbitcoincryptocurrency,,Shai,"Nothing, since you are nothing compared to number of miner, etc..

When the player plays the game it earns token. After some time, the player can withdraw the amount of tokens that are inside the game and send to your metamask wallet.
To do that, my backend signs the transaction with the private key of the owner and send tokens to the player (i´m paying the gas because i´m doing this transaction).
But I want to transfer the gas fees to the player. How can I do this strategy?
There are a lot of NFT games that implements this strategy right now, but I don´t know how to use web3 and solidity to do that.",blockchainethereumsolidityweb3jserc20,"Aug 11, 2022 at 18:03",TylerH,"Which gas fees do you want to transfer?

                gas fees relates with every withdraw that player claim. Every claim the contract needs to pay gas fee in order to transfer tokens from wallet to player.

                i didn't understood, the balance of the user is off-chain (like on a db) and when a user do a withdraw you want to delete balance from db and send the amount withdrawn from your wallet to the user wallet, right?

                @JacopoMosconi yes. you are right. if I have 3000 players I need to pay gas fee for everyone. How deal with it?

                I think that in this casee you don't want to send a gas fee to each player (wich you can send wei) but you want to pay the gas fee for a withdrawal. As you said, just have a backend that checks for withdrawals and make a withdrawal server-side to avoid your player paying a gas fee. Sending the necessary ether to each player would be very inefficient.

                Is there a contract on the _router address implementing the IUniswapV2Router02 interface? Same question for address _uniswapV2Rtr.factory() implementing the IUniswapV2Factory interface. It's possible that you're trying to deploy the contract on an emulator network (such as Remix VM) that had the other contracts deleted for some reason. Or that you used to deploy them on a network that contains these contracts but now you have changed to a different network that doesn't have them... Please provide steps to reproduce your issue.

                This won't work on the Remix VM as there are no contracts on the addresses specified in my first comment. What environment are you using (Remix VM, Ropsten, Ethereum mainnet, ...)? Can you check that there are in fact the expected contracts deployed on the expected addresses?

I don't know if there is anything useful in it, but decided I would post it here for feedback on the idea and to see if it was actually plausible.
The blockchains are growing, and ones like Ethereum are growing FAST. This isn't sustainable for a lot of miners, and having a lot of miners is crucial to validate the chain.
Intro: Data Server node, Fetch Nodes
What if you didn't have to store the entire blockchain to solve blocks on the blockchain?
NOTE: all hashing below is SHA256 in theory
Essentially the Fetch Nodes store the chain, but each block only contains 3 SHA256 hashes rather than an entire list of ~1500-3000 transactions that takes up 1 mb per block. These 3 hashes are the block's hash, the fetch hash, and the previous block's hash.
Here is how it works:
Fetch nodes take in incoming transactions from the memory pool, filling up a block same as normal. This data is hashed to obtain a fetch hash, which along with the hash of the previous block, is hashed once more to obtain the block's hash. Great, so now we have the data, a previous block hash, a fetch hash, and a block hash.
On the fetch nodes, the block hash, fetch hash, and previous block hash are stored as a block. The only data in the block is those 3 hashes.
This data is all stored on the data servers alongside its corresponding fetch hash.
When fetching data, the data servers use fetch hashes.
Data server nodes store all the transaction data and corresponding fetch hashes for each group of transaction data.
Here is what data will be stored on the Data Node like :
{
fetchhash:""""
body: transactions
}
If we want to fetch data with a block hash, the fetch node sends a request to search a data server node using that block's fetch hash. When found it is returned in appropriate format.
If we want to validate the data on the servers, we just have to check that the transaction data hashed truly outputs the fetch hash. If not, then we know the chain is invalid.
This means that these fetch nodes, storing just 3 hashes per block, can still be used to validate the entire chain.
(of course, the fetch nodes will also have the job of validating transactions. The benefit that is gained is through storage.)
Data server nodes are compensated in coin by fetch nodes which are compensated by mining.",node.jshashblockchainethereumcryptocurrency,,Saveer Jain,"This is a question and answer site for questions that can be answered objectively, not only subjectively.  This is not a general discussion site.  So, if you have a specific question you're asking and something you'd like a specific answer to, then please reword your post into that specific question.

                This cannot work as the execution needs to be deterministic, so that the nodes that validate can also run all this and get the same results. This problem is drastically more complex than you think it is. Read about ethereum oracles and how they can be used to provide randomness.

                In that case you can use the || in javascript, if you are using react they have specific format on that, in vue I mostly use ((objFromWallets || {}). design || ''). toString(), this example states that if objFromWallets is undefined or null or not an object, then set its value as {} (empty object) so the you can still use it as object then do the dot notation for design property, so when the design is not present on the object then assign a value of '' (empty string)

                Sorry Im not totattly good at React, Im a Vue developer as of now, but base on my experience, in vue, there are times that data by default, especially component properties has a value of null, so to solve the issues I have to use the above solution. because the data will only be filled when an update happen. Glad it helps mate :)

                Assuming useWallet is a hook, then the issue probably happens because when Next.js pre-renders the page on the server the wallets value must be an empty array (most likely its default value?). You should move any operation with wallets inside a useEffect call to ensure it only happens on the client-side, when useWallet actually returns the expected value for wallets.

There are M interconnected nodes in a peer-to-peer network. Initially, each node numbers itself with any integer from 1-N, N<=M.
Each node counts the most occurrences of neighboring nodes, including itself, and modifies its number to that value.
If all the numbers occur equally, a non-self number is randomly selected and changed to that number.
Each node notifies its neighbors when initialization is complete or when the numbering is updated.
Q:
Can this rule achieve final agreement on the numbering of all nodes?

The point of the add org3 components in test-network is to highlight the steps and information required to add another organisation, so the recommendation here would be to read the hyperledger fabric documentation and study the test-network approach on adding an organisation.

                Can you see chaincode container on a machine where your peer is running? Instantiating in 1.4 should spawn one. Your logs seem to be fine indeed.

                Interesting, you even have logs from it. Can you try running docker container ls -f 'status=exited' to list exited containers and check if there are containers of your chaincode (you may also try checking if there is at least an image created by running docker images) and if there is any - output its logs?

What I am trying to do is call a contract where I pass x amount of token coins and pass contract address and token address. However it's failing.
the Abi contract comes from web server which gives me the json string for the Abi contract.
It's failing on the call with NodeError
Just to explain what I am doing here is we have coins on a token on the ether wallet.  Our Abi contract exchanges those token coins to another coin which is not on the ether blockchain.
This is why our value is 0 for ether but we pass our 3 parameters of
approveAndCall(address _spender, uint256 _amount, string _destination)
Which is our API function
Our ABI functions work fine on web but im struggling to get this running on iOS.  Any help would be most helpful.
var web3 = Web3.InfuraMainnetWeb3()
    if AppDataModelManager.shared.testModeStatus() {
        
        web3 = Web3.InfuraRinkebyWeb3()
    }

    let abiContract = self.getDepositABIContract(completion: { abiJson in
    
        let value: String = ""0"" // Any amount of Ether you need to send
        let walletAddress = EthereumAddress(wallet.address)! // Your wallet address
        let contractMethod = ""approveAndCall"" // Contract method you want to write
        let contractABI = abiJson
        let contractAddress = EthereumAddress(AppDataModelManager.shared.getNetworkStatus().getDepositTokenAddress())!
        let abiVersion = 2 // Contract ABI version
        let parameters: [Any] = [walletAddress, UInt64(amountString) ?? 0,toAddress] // Parameters for contract method
        let extraData: Data = Data() // Extra data for contract method
        let contract = web3.contract(contractABI ?? """", at: contractAddress, abiVersion: abiVersion)!
        var options = TransactionOptions.defaultOptions
        options.value = Web3.Utils.parseToBigUInt(value, units: .eth)
        options.from = walletAddress
        options.gasPrice = .automatic
        options.gasLimit = .automatic

        let txMessage = contract.write(
            contractMethod,
            parameters:  parameters as [AnyObject],
            extraData: extraData,
            transactionOptions: options)!

                OK I am sorry if I did not explain the result I am trying to achieve.  So we have a token on ether blockchain. We have our own coin. We have an ABI contact.  So I want to pass the ether address of the wallet I want to send the token address of our token I want to send the ABI json string of our contact I want to send the amount of tokens I want to transfer from the token into the new coin.  However the call function is failing.  Not sure if its because this wrapper is old and not upto date with web3

It's around 25k transactions as of today. I've tried different libraries such as ether and etherscanr but none seem to be working.

This works fine up to page 10, in which I get the following message from res$mes:
[1] ""Result window is too large, PageNo x Offset size must be less than or equal to 10000""
I understand the error message, but could there be any workaround to this? I heard about using the block number and iterate through that but that would increase the number of API calls beyond than the free plan.
Any other alternative is greatly appreciated, thanks!",rapiblockchainethereum,,luisgonzalez,"Add a comment

how to apply javascript promises for async data hashing,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69967952/how-to-apply-javascript-promises-for-async-data-hashing,0,0,244,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Giue1blEHpP0G6M37p8lNWtNr6UT0wmBQd-5Y03=k-s32,"Nov 14, 2021 at 23:13",1,Saveer Jain,https://stackoverflow.com/users/17413367/saveer-jain,how to apply javascript promises for async data hashing,"1 year, 3 months ago","1 year, 3 months ago","In an online blockchain developer course I am participating in, one prerequisite was javascript object oriented & async programming, which I do not have experience in. However, having some experience in programming, I figured I would just learn as I go.
A practice activity (not a graded one, those I can not get help on) on blockchain hashing wants us to create an async hashing function using promises to hash data with SHA256. There are 2 main files: app.js, and block.js .
app.js (this was given to us, it is the main file we run):
/**
 * Importing the Block class
 */
//
const BlockClass = require('./block.js');

/**
 * Creating a block object
 */
const block = new BlockClass.Block(""Test Block"");

// Generating the block hash
block.generateHash().then((result) => {
    console.log(`Block Hash: ${result.hash}`);
    console.log(`Block: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
}).catch((error) => {console.log(error)});

/**
 * Step 3: Run the application in node.js
 * 
 */

// From the terminal: cd into Project folder
// From the terminal: Run node app.js to run the code

block.js ( the arrows indicate the part I added myself, everything else was given.
/**
 * Import crypto-js/SHA256 library
 */
const SHA256 = require('crypto-js/sha256');

/**
 * Class with a constructor for block 
 */
class Block {

    constructor(data){
        this.id = 0;
        this.nonce = 144444;
        this.body = data;
        this.hash = """";
    }
    
    /**
     * Step 1. Implement `generateHash()`
     * method that return the `self` block with the hash.
     * 
     * Create a Promise that resolve with `self` after you create 
     * the hash of the object and assigned to the hash property `self.hash = ...`
     */
    // 
    generateHash() {
        // Use this to create a temporary reference of the class object
        let self = this;

> //Implement your code here
>         self.hash = SHA256(JSON.stringify(self.body));
>           const promise = new Promise(function(myResolve,myReject){
>           if(self.hash = SHA256(JSON.stringify(self.body))){
>           myResolve(self);

Utilizing online resources, I do sort of understand promises, but not really- and definitely not how to apply them here. I was hoping I could get some help on this.",javascripthashblockchaines6-promise,,Saveer Jain,"3
            
        
        
            
                
                This task doesn't really make sense. crypto-js does not appear to support asynchronous operation, so there's no point in using promises here. You might want to ask for clarification from your instructor.

                learn as you go by reading this from head to tail. Review the excellent code examples. Reference your code, there is no need to use a promise if you are going to use it directly as you have in your code. The idea is to return promise so it can be used by the caller.

                @Bergi - it appears the exercise is to create and return a Promise to demonstrate how it works (apparently using a library that is in no way asynchronous).

                Main property of hash functions is that you cannot go back to the original input knowing the output. If you know that two identical hashes where generated you cannot say if the input was the same or it is an hash collision (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision)

Error: Service(Telemetry(IoError(Custom { kind: Other, error: ""Error parsing resolv.conf: ProtoError { kind: Msg(\""Malformed label: --\"") }"" })))

Got the above error while running the node in staging mode and it is working fine in dev mode.
How did I run it in staging mode:-
Firstly extracted customspec file using below command-
./target/release/substrate build-spec --disable-default-bootnode --chain staging > customSpec.json

After I have made few changes to it (changed staking,session and balances configurations)
and then I have converted it into customSpecRaw file using below command
./target/release/substrate build-spec --chain=customSpec.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > customSpecRaw.json

Then I got the output as
2021-09-21 02:46:00 Low open file descriptor limit configured for the process. Current value: 4096, recommended value: 10000.

and after this I started the node using-

then got this error-

Getting React useEffect to display updated variable after contract call?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69174914/getting-react-useeffect-to-display-updated-variable-after-contract-call,0,0,351,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJzGS5YFCxSLgEF5K4QWzUucoYK3yWXnntcB7Xsd=k-s32,"Sep 14, 2021 at 9:03",17,Bdellinger,https://stackoverflow.com/users/16019624/bdellinger,Getting React useEffect to display updated variable after contract call?,"1 year, 5 months ago","1 year, 2 months ago","I'm working on a blockchain application using react function components. The application would allow people to deposit ERC20 tokens.
I've been trying for the last few days to get the useEffect hook to watch for state changes coming in from the blockchain and display them once they occur, but have not had success.
I know this fundamentally working with my useEffect hook as the application updates its displayed state when an account is loaded from a wallet/on an account state variable change, which it's watching for. However, because I believe there is a delay when it's making a contract call, it seems to run through and update itself before that new updated information comes from the blockchain.
I'm trying to get it so that when the user deposits their token, the app calls the smart contract to deposit using await, then once the token is deposited it calls for the new balance and sets the state, this is then displayed in the app without having to refresh the page.
I tried several methods including promises, having a shorterm loop run until the data is updated (which just spammed my app with calls), etc.
Any advice or links to guides that cover updating state using useEffect, especially for blockchain calls, would be much appreciated!
function App() {
  
  const [tether, setTether] = React.useState([undefined]);
  const [tetherAddress, setTetherAddress] = React.useState("""");
  
  const [tetherBalance, setTetherBalance] = React.useState(""0"");
  
  const [amountDeposited, setAmountDeposited] = React.useState(""0"");
  
  window.web3 = new Web3(window.web3.currentProvider);

Skipping the load web 3 & contract instances for brevity...
  useEffect(() => {

    const init = async () => {

        //Load our staking state and other account data

        if (account !== undefined){
          let tetherBalance = await tether.methods.balanceOf(account).call().then()
          setTetherBalance(tetherBalance.toString())
         
          let amountDeposited = await chadsVault.methods.amountDeposited(account).call();
          setAmountDeposited(amountDeposited.toString());

    }
    init();
  }, [account, tetherBalance, amountDeposited]);",reactjsreact-hooksblockchainethereumuse-effect,,Bdellinger,"As an update, I'm attempting a work around where I use a timeout to wait for the new data so that it can update state. It works - but this doesn't take into account the varying times it takes for a blockchain tx to be mined.   I'm not sure how to configure this to wait for the transaction to complete.

deposit seems to work, but the problem is on withdraw and both functions, those two fail with REVERT opcode executed. .
Before I call withdraw I have approved contract address from WTRX smart contract.
From my investigation I suppose that is from msg.sender.transfer(sad) inside the wtrx.withdraw function.
Does somebody know how to solve this problem and make this functions work? Thanks!
WTRX contract can be found here: https://tronscan.io/#/token20/TNUC9Qb1rRpS5CbWLmNMxXBjyFoydXjWFR/code
My contract code:
contract TestTransfer {
function deposit(address payable wtrxAddr) public payable{
    WTRX wtrx = WTRX(wtrxAddr);

    // TRX to WTRX Token
    wtrx.deposit.value(msg.value)();

    // Transfer TRX to caller
    wtrx.transfer(msg.sender, msg.value);
}

function withdraw(address payable wtrxAddr, uint sad) public{
    WTRX wtrx = WTRX(wtrxAddr);

    // Transfer WTRX Token from owner to contract
    wtrx.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sad);

    // WTRX Token to TRX
    wtrx.withdraw(sad);
    
    // Transfer TRX to caller
    msg.sender.transfer(sad);

"Endless loop stops checking IF functions after first one is correct - Python, Blockchain transactions",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68830672/endless-loop-stops-checking-if-functions-after-first-one-is-correct-python-bl,0,0,57,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh6sCni-9Y3W5eHWbBT0yPbxLo9I86uaAAvCnzf5A=k-s32,"Aug 18, 2021 at 10:28",1,user16695835,https://stackoverflow.com/users/16695835/user16695835,"Endless loop stops checking IF functions after first one is correct - Python, Blockchain transactions","1 year, 6 months ago",3 months ago,"I am looking more specifically at Web3, in the aim of creating a script to send off blockchain transactions four times - three times before the intended 'starting block', and then finally sending one when it reaches the starting block. Firstly, i produced the first code, my thinking behind this is that it checks the latest_block every 0.1 seconds, in turn running thorough the if statements, and if the latest_block is either of the 4 defined variables, it will run the function ""run_wallets"". However, from trialling it, it works correctly for the first block which it encounters (the three_before variable) and then stops checking the statements once it has found one 'True' statement.
starting_block = 10079310
one_before = 10079309
two_before = 10079308
three_before = 10079307


def update():
    while True:

        time.sleep(0.1)
        latest_block = web3.eth.blockNumber
        print(latest_block)

        if latest_block == three_before:
            run_wallets()

        elif latest_block == two_before:
            run_wallets()

        elif latest_block == one_before:
            run_wallets()

        elif latest_block == starting_block:
            run_wallets()

update()

This is understandable as the loop will stop once it has a 'true' statement. I therefore tried to create a list, and make a loop that will keep running until the list is empty. So this time, once the first IF statement was true, it would remove the variable from the list so that it is no longer in the list, and therefore will run the wallets on the other 3 blocks until the list is empty. I had a go and produced the following, which still isn't working..
starting_block = 10079310
one_before = 10079309
two_before = 10079308
three_before = 10079307


list = [ three_before, two_before, one_before, starting_block ]

def update():
      while list:

        time.sleep(0.1)
        latest_block = web3.eth.blockNumber
        print(latest_block)

        if latest_block in list:
            run_wallets()
            list.remove(three_before)

        if latest_block in list:
            run_wallets()
            list.remove(two_before)

        if latest_block in list:
            run_wallets()
            list.remove(one_before)

        if latest_block in list:
            run_wallets()
            list.remove(starting_block)

update()

Therefore overall, can someone show me what I'm doing wrong and kindly point me in the right direction?",pythonlistblockchainweb3py,"Oct 26, 2022 at 20:45",TylerH,"In both examples you omit the parentheses on run_wallets in the first if-clause, meaning the function isn't called.

                Yes I tried to use useEffect hook from react whenever I call smart contract function from frontend but it did not work. I guess we cannot use function call as a dependency for useEffect to trigger the update.

 Defense against second-preimage attack consists in the following security measures:
    - Before computing the hash of a leaf, prepend the corresponding record with 0x00
    - Before computing the hash of any interior node, prepend both of its parents' hashes with 0x01

(I understand that 0x00 and 0x01 are just ""specific byte values"" and they could be anything)
Why does this work?
Can't an attacker theoretically find a leaf hash of a forged content that begins with 0x00 ?

                Hello @MaartenBodewes I disagree with the conclusion: a merkle tree is a data structure like could be a binary tree or red black tree or many more. In my opinion it's very helpful to understand why this structure inner workings exposes a vulnerability in some scenarios. BTW I actually found the answer from that time ,but I also forgot it :D I need to find the notes from that time to re-answer the question

                I use a similar benchmark model: initialize accounts, then round-robin on them by tracking the nonce to prevent outdated and other errors. The WebSockets are load-balanced with an ingress controller (the nodes are on a cloud using Kubernetes): so difficult to know precisely how the client WebSockets requests are attributed to each node (anyhow, I have not more than 10 WebSockets open). The question stays the same, what is the difference between the two elements? How can it be that the nodes don't share the same number of finished transactions?

                Are all nodes block producers (authorities in AuRa)? It is possible that transactions are being validated and then not included in blocks as they are not gossiped to the block producer. I would expect your load balancing being opaque to what node is targeted might make this difficult to assess directly. Here is more details on tx processing: substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/learn-substrate/…

                This code does not seem to work, you are missing either semicolons or newlines. In general, you can chain assignment operators e.g.: x = y = 2;, as the assignment operator returns with the assigned value, like: x = (y = 2);, where the result of y=2; is 2.

I've little experience with the blockchain, mainly a simple ERC20 token projet I did a few months ago.
Now for my bachelor thesis, i was asked the following :

Develop one or several smart contract(s) to trace the origin of the product and its
conformity certifications / administrative attributes and behaviours.
Register the product on the blockchain and deploy a validation scheme to protect it
against counterfeit
Protect the production method (recipe) as an IPR

The said ""product"" in this refers mainly to manufactured pieces, like a watch piece.
This project is a proof of concept more than anything else so I have no real pieces. I have to create a mockup of what could be used in a manufacture.
Now I was wondering what to use to achieve this goal. Are NFTs are a good option to insure each piece's conformity or should it be used only for the final product or else ?
I don't know all the possibilities of the technology, thus why I'm asking for help.
Any leads to what to use or tutorials would be more than welcome.
Thanks in advance",hyperledger-fabricblockchainethereumsolidity,,DrOrgasmatron,"Company ""emertech"" already have such blockchain products (anti-counterfeit and logging), see their site: emertech.hk/en

                Yeah i know my question isn't exactly a good fit fo SO but I didn't know where else to ask since most ethereum forums i came accross seemed dead. And yeah a 50-100 page document is propably what I have to produce in this project. Maybe someone could indicate me a better place to ask my question ?

SHA256 of block header _hexadecimal vs string,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67374582/sha256-of-block-header-hexadecimal-vs-string,0,0,92,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a18498d33b063a611036e98cd4c71b81?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"May 3, 2021 at 19:14",3,Marklah,https://stackoverflow.com/users/11456085/marklah,SHA256 of block header _hexadecimal vs string,"1 year, 9 months ago","1 year, 9 months ago","I am new to blockchain and don't have an IT background.
Trying to understand the technique of SHA256 of block header component/paramters (i.e previous hash, merkel rule, difficulity level..etc) when appended together.
I noticed that most online SHA256 accepts only string (or text) as input. Thus, i am unable to verify the Block hash using combined block paramters, which are in hex, in these SHA256. There is some online converter which accept hex decimal entry. But since i already have a macro XML request established to one of the online SHA256 text converter, i am wondering if there is any way that i can convert the block hex parameters into string first then use that string into into SHA256 text converter and of course get the same result.
I also understand some hex-decimal character are control character (e.g 00,01..etc) and may not be converted into string. I just wanted to confirm that ? Please note I am not looking into any decoding in any programming language just want to know if a conversion is possible/ correct approach and if yes, what process/method should be followed?
Example, genesis block with appended parameters of 0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003ba3edfd7a7b12b27ac72c3e67768f617fc81bc3888a51323a9fb8aa4b1e5e4a29ab5f49ffff001d1dac2b7c  >>> whether this can be converted into text/string.
Many thanks",stringhashblockchainbitcoinsha,,Marklah,"sha256 operates on bytes, and because not every byte value is a displayable character there must be some way for the sha256 tool to accommodate arbitrary byte sequences. Presenting the input as hex-encoded bytes is common, as is base64 encoding. If you've an online sha256 tool that accepts hex-encoded input then you can use that. If you have a text string then you must decide how to convert that to bytes. Modern standards specify UTF-8. If you can find an online tool that accepts text characters and returns hex-encoded UTF-8 output then that's what you can provide as input to the SHA256 tool.

                many thanks for your answer. there was a part in my question that has not been answered i am afraid. can (and is this a correct approach?) i ALWAYS convert the hexdecimal into text and then use the output text into SHA256 that accepts text and get the same result had i  used sha256 on the original Hexdecimal input? my main concern is mainly on the non printable character of the hex when converting into text ?

Then I unlock account on node 1:
personal.unlockAccount(""0xd4b49495ea94285b0a8af7d813e089fc6c87311c"", pass phrase)

Then I use the sendTransaction() as specified above on node 1.

ADD ./genesis.json /root/mygenesis.json
EXPOSE 8545 8546 30303 30303/udp

For the most part I followed this tutorial: https://pragmaticintegrator.wordpress.com/2017/11/05/set-up-private-blockchain-with-ethereum-part-2/
I am just starting out on the topic and don't really understand most of what is happening. Is it possible that I somehow have to sign the transaction? How would I do this?
Thank you for any help, I appreciate it.",transactionsblockchainethereum,"Apr 26, 2021 at 17:21",,"Please edit your question and show how you use the eth.sendTransaction. Do you input it in the node console (which node? geth? openethereum? other?) or use it in a JavaScript snippet with web3js? ... Most likely your transaction is not signed. But how to sign it - it depends on how you create the transaction and send it to the node.

                First, thanks for your reply. yes, i think that you are right. it's about a document flow, it can be created and filled first, then it must be approved by another group of users, they read it, then if it's okey, they validate the document. so a manual validation means a document validation by the user examinator of the docuement.

                As I recall, the reenroll command actually requires you to use existing identity crypto material and not username/password.  You can probably just leverage the enroll command here rather than reenroll.

                Hey @BrendanLesniak, thanks so much for ur answer.  Alright, so this project is basicly what i want to try from a guy who uploaded it on github, and it has no discription in it on how to run it. Here's the link : github.com/hardik22317/Blockchain-based_E-Voting What i want to do is test it out. I would like to ask u if u have like a few minutes to check it out and actually run the app and u will conclude what i'm telling, once u want to Cast a Vote, it just doesn't work.  Thanks a lot.

Soft limits (after checking by ""ulimit -n"") were equal 1024 - it's was the source of the problem. Setting it to 65000 solved it.

Best way to create multiple LinkedLists of Hashmaps with multiple keys and values?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65696448/best-way-to-create-multiple-linkedlists-of-hashmaps-with-multiple-keys-and-value,0,0,42,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/141f600e79f39facb1a09705f8ead0f2?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Jan 13, 2021 at 6:00",65,L M,https://stackoverflow.com/users/10625930/l-m,Best way to create multiple LinkedLists of Hashmaps with multiple keys and values?,"2 years, 1 month ago","2 years, 1 month ago","So the title does a terrible job at explaining what I mean, so let me explain.
So I basically want to make a mini cryptocurrency blockchain as a project. I'm trying to think of the best thing to use as the blocks in a blockchain. I'd need the blocks to hold the header information which is the following:
Previous Blocks Hash. Timestamp. Difficulty Target. Nonce. Version. Merkle Root.
And then the transactions that are also contained within each block. All in all the block would end up looking like this.

I thought a Hashmap would be the best way to do this as you can assign each of the above keys a value, but I'm not sure how I'd go about it. I would need a list that held the Hashmaps which held multiple keys and values, but I'd also need the list to hold whatever the transactions would be held in. I'd also need the next list to be able to see the previous list (so it can get the hash from everything in its header).
Could anyone give me some advice on the best way to deal with this? Been thinking it over for the last few days but I don't think I'm coming any closer to an answer.
Thank you.",javalinked-listhashmapblockchain,,L M,"2
            
        
        
            
                
                Generally speaking, in Java it is better to define a class if you know what the field names and types all are.  It is more efficient, uses less space ... and it is compile time type safe.  Defining a class (or two) to represent the above should be straight-forward, though it is a little unclear (to me) what the image actually means.

And I found that error is in ""ServiceReceiver(receiver).pay{value: msg.value}(serviceName);"" of ServicePayer.sol.
last address parameter of deploy function in  2_deploy_token.js is my wallet address. is it correct?
And I tried to use remix. But I couldn't deploy it.
What Can I do for this error?
Help me,everyone!

I'm trying to find for each transaction the amount of money moved by summing all the outputs unless those that have the same address of the inputs.  This is the piece of code:
moneymoved = []
for tr in transactions:
    money = 0
    for outp in tr['out']:
      w = 0
      while w < len(e['inputs']):    
        if outp['addr'] != tr['inputs'][w]['prev_out']['addr']:
           money = money + outp['value']
           moneymoved.append(money)
           w = w + 1 
        else:
            w = w + 1

I think that ""moneymoved.append"" is in the wrong position, as It should execute after the calcolous of all outputs inside each transaction. How can I proceed?",pythonjsonblockchain,,Jaden146,"I agree with you.  The append should be after the while loop.  You can move w = w + 1 out of the if block as well since you do that in either case after the if.  Beyond that, I don't think there's enough information here for the community to be of much more help.  Even if we could help, what you're talking about is the basic task of programming.  You have to run your program over and over, watch what it's doing (you should be using a good visual debugger), and expand it line by line by matching code to what you want the code to do.  This is the learning you have todo.

                Thank you Steve, I have already tried to move out the append and also the w = w + 1, but the problem is that the list money moved is of higher size than the number of transactions. Inputs and out are two keys which I want to compare in their adressess in order to know if the output value must be included or not inside the list money moved. My aim is to create a list which contain, in each position, the moneymoved in the reference transaction.

I want to know why the writing time is decreasing while increasing data volume. And also for the 60 input data takes more time to write.

If you want to understand this better, you can dissect both underlying Ethereum node (Go). web3.js library and JSON-RPC protocol how it behaves. However I feel making assumptions based on measurements from an environment that is supposed to be highly asynchronous and volatile in timing, does not really make sense.

                So, server closes connection for some other reason. Server log files may really help, also useful is to run client in debug mode.  One of possible reasons of such error is versions mismatch.

We're storing large amounts of data in transactions as strings.  We've hit the size limit (we think, open to thoughts there too) and have been able to span the data across multiple transactions, etc., so the ability to store everything we want isn't really the issue.
We are storing just a long string of hexadecimal characters, and what we're wondering is if instead of string, we could store them more efficiently as something else and maybe stretch the data field out by switching from string to a different datatype specialized for hexadecimal.
Any ideas?  Like I said, we're operational, but I've bene having a hard time figuring out whether this is possible, or even a good idea.  The hexadecimal ""0xab34ef6......26ef"" would not resolve to a number or anything (its a string of independent characters that just happen to be hex.

                We ran into similar issues.  We're at the point that we'll require multiple transactions at any rate, so it't actually not a huge deal to just spread them across as many as it needs once we're doing it at all... not proud of it, but time to move on to new issues :)

The management of this supply chain implies to track-and-trace (geolocate) a drug on the chain, but also to monitor the storage temperature to see if the cold chain is respected. For that I created a mock-up of the POC my Dapps (https://balsamiq.cloud/sum5oq5/p8lsped)and also I wanted to prepare myself by doing a UML and a use cases. However, I didn't find a lot of information about blockchain's UML and use cases besides two literatures which were quite different, so I don't know if what I did was correct or not...

The users of my Dapps will be the following ones:

The stakeholders (Manufacturers, Distributors and Retailers) which will use the Dapps to place orders and also monitor them. They also can search in the historic a specific order. Finally, trough IOT sensors they update the conditions of the order (temperature & location).
The administrator which roles is to update the Dapps and its rules. But also to add or delete user while also defining the rights that they have on the blockchain (I intend to use a permisionned blockchain). Finally, they are also here to help in case of technical problem.


The Dapps that I'm thinking about works in the following:

A user, the customer, can place an order (a list of products) to a
certain seller and choose the final destination of the order.
The order is then put together before being shipped or stocked in the
depots of one of the stakeholders (distributor or retailer) with a
description of the stocking and/or shipping condition of the product
(for example the product must be stocked or transported in a room
with a temperature of less than 5°C). During the shipping and
storing, an IOT device will feed the drops with the temperature and
geolocation of the product by updating the data each 5-10mn.
Obviously they will be a function that allows all the users to see
the history of the order passed and search inside a specific order.
In case where the temperature doesn't respect the temperature
recommended, then the smart-contract send an alert. The same if the
collocation of the product is ""weird"" like being in some European
countries and not in an Asian country, an alert will be sent again by
the smart-contractual. Finally, in the case where the product is sent
to the asked location by the customer, then the money for the order
will be paid to the seller.


So based on what I explained, I came here in hope that someone tell me if the use cases and UML that I did were correct or not.

I also added how my Dapps works, I completely forgot about it even trough I had it my Dapps's specification document.

I am considering using Hyperledger Fabric for implementing private blockchain.
Use case
As we know blockchain works with unknown parties which want to work together without any middle man. So, my use case is similar to this.
One organisation wants to deal with different vendors residing in different cities in the country which are not known to organisation. Now, we want to make smart contract according to our business logic between the organisation and vendors to do further transactions.
We will map our organisation to fabric organisation. But what to with vendors? As vendors are not separate organisation, they are individual entities.
I have worked for multi organisations with fabric but how should we make this architecture to work correctly where only one organisation is involved?",hyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledger,,Honey Shah,"You can implement it in chaincodes as business logic. Think about how you would solve this problem in relational databases. You can implement similar logic in chaincode with composite keys etc.

                Yes, I can do that. But I have question regarding architecture. I mean how much organisations I need to create? If I create organisation for each vendor then it will have separate peer and db also and it will require more server resources. What about CA? Do I need to create CA cluster with each org?

I was using fabric 2.1.0 and caliper 0.3.2. I specified net-test in docker-compose to make sure caliper container is in the same network as fabric.
Can someone please help?",hyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledger-caliper,"Jul 6, 2020 at 7:50",Vadim Kotov,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                You've set the CA endpoints as localhost. Because you are running containerized caliper localhost is not available. You need to use the service name instead of localhost, expose the ports in docker-compose, and make sure both caliper and your fabric components are running on the same docker network.

                In the docker-compose file, under services, its just the name of each stanza, so if you look at your caliper compose file, under services, the entry is named caliper that would be how you would refer to it. So for other services you refer to them by the same name you declared under the services section in your docker-compose file. But just remember, they need to be on the same docker network

I've been developing a smart contract for SAP Hyperledger Fabric in Go, and I've got a problem with the ""qscc"" chaincode when I try to call it via Swagger API, the code of the chaincode is: 

func (cc *registroHorario) query(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface, args []string) peer.Response {
    TxId := args[0]
    invokeArgs := ToChaincodeArgs(""GetBlockByTxID"", ""gesjornada"", TxId)
    response := stub.InvokeChaincode(""qscc"", invokeArgs, ""gesjornada"")
    if response.Status != shim.OK {
        return shim.Error(BytesToString(response.Payload))
    }
    value := response.Payload
    // JSON := Decode(""common.Block"", value)
    logger.Infof(""QueryResult: %s"", value)
    return shim.Success(value)
}

//ToChaincodeArgs converts string args to []byte args.
func ToChaincodeArgs(args ...string) [][]byte {
    bargs := make([][]byte, len(args))
    for i, arg := range args {
        bargs[i] = []byte(arg)
    }
    return bargs
}


and Swagger code:

/{txId}:                            #-------------------------------------------------------- GET /{txId} ==> QUERY
    get:
      tags:
        - Marcaje
      operationId: query
      summary: Listar marcaje por TxId
      parameters:
      - $ref: '#/parameters/txId'
      responses:
        200:
          description: OK
          schema:
            type: object
        400:
          description: Parameter Mismatch
        404:
          description: Not Found


When I call the API, I pass my txId as an argument and I've got the following error:

500: Error: Internal Server Error
{
  ""error"": {
    ""message"": ""INVOKE_CHAINCODE failed: transaction ID: 5172ad78a74af6fd0c45af6e7e54f92b03c8e34db1e6387d5d359d27550538fc: failed to find ledger for channel: gesjornada"",
    ""code"": ""CustomError"",
    ""status"": 500
  }

I thought it was a problem of the channel name, but I saw that channel name I got when I call Hyperledger Fabric API via SAP API HUB is that, so I've been stuck here for almost a month, can anyone help me, please?
Thank you in advance!!!",saphyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledger,"Jun 19, 2020 at 14:38",Volker,"That's strange! Have you enabled service discovery on your network?

                Hi @AdityaArora, I don't know how to do that because I'm very new in developing chaincodes with SAP environment.. I've been trying to get where the error came from, but I've got no luck since no much information is posted by them.

Getting blank response,"2 years, 8 months ago","2 years, 8 months ago","I am trying to explore private data collection and I have written the chaincode in javascript. I am passing the proper collections file while instantiating the chaincode and while invoking the chaincode I am adding the transient data in request payload which looks like this :

const proposal_request = {
  chaincodeId: chaincodeId,
  fcn: functionName,
  args: args,
  chainId: channelCode,
  txId: tx_id,
  transientMap : { ""private"" : ""test data""}
};


My chaincode file looks like this :

const shim = require('fabric-shim');
const util = require('util');

var PrivateDataChaincode = class {

 // Initialize the chaincode
 async Init(stub) {
  console.log('<================> ::Private Data Chaincode Instantion:: <=================>');
  return shim.success();
 }

 async Invoke(stub) {
  console.log('<================> ::Private Data Chaincode Invocation:: <=================>');
  let ret = stub.getFunctionAndParameters();
  console.info(ret);
  let method = this[ret.fcn];
  console.info('methodName');
  console.info(method);

  if (!method) {
   console.error('No method of name:' + ret.fcn + ' found');
   return shim.error('No method of name:' + ret.fcn + ' found. \n UNKNOWN FUNCTION INVOCATION: ' + ret.fcn);
  }
  console.info('\nCalling method : ' + ret.fcn);
  try {
   let payload = await method(stub, ret.params);
   return shim.success(payload);
  } catch (err) {
   console.log(err);
   return shim.error(err);
  }
 }

 async createPrivateDataInCollection(stub, args) {
  if (args.length != 2) {
   throw new Error('Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 2');
  }

  // arg[0] has the collection name
  // arg[1] has the key

  console.info(""============= START : Create Private data ==========="");
  // get the transient map
  let transientData = stub.getTransient();
  await stub.putPrivateData(args[0], args[1], transientData.map.private.value);
  console.info('============= END : Create private data ===========');
 }

 async queryPrivateDataInCollection(stub, args) {
  console.info('============= START : Query private Data ===========');
  // arg[0] has the collection name
  // arg[1] has the key
  // query private data with argument
  let allResults = await stub.getPrivateData(args[0], args[1]);
  if (!allResults) {
   throw shim.error(""Can't get data from state"");
  }
  console.log(allResults);
  return allResults;
 }
};

shim.start(new PrivateDataChaincode());


I am storing data using the createPrivateDataInCollection method and fetching the data using queryPrivateDataInCollection. The private data is getting stored correctly when I cross checked in the couch DB. The problem I am facing is that I am getting a blank response when I am querying the private data using queryPrivateDataInCollection method on some occasions. Sometimes I am able to see the data, while sometimes I am getting a blank response. Am I missing something important?",node.jshyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledger,"Jun 12, 2020 at 12:18",,"Can you see what is your wait timeout for query transactions? Because you are saying, it returns sometimes, but fails in a while, so you can try increasing the wait timeout on the client side.

                Hi Chintan, it actually doesn't look like a timeout error as I am getting a response, albeit an empty string. Still trying to figure out what's going wrong

The French part means that no connection can be established cause the targeted computer has refused it.

After searching a bit there might be an issue with the ports or ip addresses but not sure.

ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)


I'm trying to call the get_balance() function which is in the transaction_block module via my wallet.py. The get_balance() collects data from my transactions module inputs array. While there are 3 arguments in my inputs array but I'm getting only 2 values when I call function's inputs call. So where am I going wrong here?

transactions module:

def __init__(self):
        self.inputs = []
        self.outputs = []
        self.signatures = []
        self.required = []

    def add_input(self, from_address, amount, index = 0):
        self.inputs.append((from_address, amount, index))


transaction_block module:

def get_balance (pu_key, last_block):
    this_block = last_block
    bal = 0.0
    while this_block != None:
        for txn in this_block.data:
            print(txn.inputs)
            for addr, amt, inx in txn.inputs:
                if addr == pu_key:
                    bal = bal - amt

                if addr == pu_key:
                    bal = bal + amt
        this_block = this_block.previous_block
    return bal


If you require the entire code, I've linked it here as I've tried to keep this question clutter free. If you want to run this entire code, run the wallet.py module and you'll encounter this error.",pythonpython-3.xblockchain,,jazera,"1

The setting up crypto materials part and the channel initialization part works fine (adding peer and order to the channel and initializing it)

I get errors during QueryProposal or a TransactionProposal, that is , if I want to do anything after initializing channel with the required crypto material

This is the error trace:


  Message Request processing failed; nested exception is
  org.hyperledger.fabric.sdk.exception.ProposalException:

  cause=io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AnnotatedConnectException:
  Connection refused: no further information:
  localhost/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:7051


I have tried changing docker images, did not work, same error, I have a feeling that this error has something to do with grpcs refusing to connect with the peer on the port? Is there something that i have missed or something that can prevent from accessing the peer. Somewhere is the port already used, or a firewall maybe ? Because this worked in another system with the same steps. Not really sure about this.
Suggestions would help !

Thanks",javahyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledger,,Skadoosh,"I think you need to setup a virtual network channel between your two docker images (or an overlay). Make sure ""peer0.org1.example.com"" is correct for your configuration. Honestly it's hard to tell without more context. Why do you have ordererProperties.setProperty(""hostnameOverride"", ""orderer.example.com""); ? And Orderer orderer = hfClient.newOrderer(""orderer.example.com"", ""grpcs://localhost:7050""); ??? that looks like public samples that need to be changed - or read from the environment (12-factors)

                this is just the example sample given in the hyperledger fabric java sdk test. I think the ""hostnameOverride"" tells that you can use localhost, or ordere.example.com, anything should be fine. I dont think that would be a problem, since the exact same code works in another machine with the same setup properly

                is there a configuration that i have missed with docker or grpcs that prevents the connection. I think there is something that is refusing connection there. Or are you saying that the hostname could be an issue here ?

                I'm pretty sure your hostnames are just wrong. That's what the message ""getConfigBlock for channel mychannel failed with peer peer0.org1.example.com"" is telling you. That is pointing pretty firmly at peerProperties.setProperty(""hostnameOverride"", ""peer0.org1.example.com""); - but it's really hard to tell. And I can't tell why you're overriding the hostname in the first place.

Error validating channel creation transaction for new channel creation at a Hyperledger Fabric Network,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60981250/error-validating-channel-creation-transaction-for-new-channel-creation-at-a-hype,0,0,1k,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91e84b0941a1421369b4851ffc563afe?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG,"Apr 1, 2020 at 22:21",1,Hanes,https://stackoverflow.com/users/1172411/hanes,Error validating channel creation transaction for new channel creation at a Hyperledger Fabric Network,"2 years, 10 months ago","2 years, 10 months ago","Background

I am trying to finish the Fabric CA Operations Guide tutorial in order to better understand the details of a TLS setup. However, I am stuck at the Create and Join Channel part.

A similar question was asked here at peer-channel-creation-fails-in-hyperledger-fabric, but sometimes the same errors can have different causes.

I followed the instructions at the aforementioned solution without success. The error I keep getting when I try to create the channel is:

Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error validating channel creation transaction for new channel 'mychannel', could not successfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  /Channel/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied




Environment

My versions for Docker images are:


Docker engine version: 19.03.8;
Docker CA image and version: hyperledger/fabric-ca:1.4.6;
Docker Peer image and version: hyperledger/fabric-peer:2.0;
Docker Orderer image and version: hyperledger/fabric-orderer:2.0;
Docker Tools (CLI) image and version: hyperledger/fabric-tools:2.0.



Reproducing the error


  I created a repository at GitHub where I put the codes referenced by the links: fabric-ca-operations-guide.



I start by executing tearup-docker-cas.sh to create all the Docker images for the CAs and consequently the directory structures at /tmp/hyperledger/:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanesbarbosa/fabric-ca-operations-guide/master/tearup-docker-cas.sh | bash -s
When I check that every image is up and running by issuing the command docker ps I create the crypto material using setup-crypto.sh:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanesbarbosa/fabric-ca-operations-guide/master/setup-crypto.sh | bash -s
Then I download the configtx.yaml file to my current directory:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanesbarbosa/fabric-ca-operations-guide/master/configtx.yaml -o ./configtx.yaml
Now I am ready to set the environment variable FABRIC_CFG_PATH so that I can create the genesis block and channel transaction by the create_genesis_block_channel_tx.sh script. The artifacts will be available at /tmp/hyperledger/org0/orderer/:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanesbarbosa/fabric-ca-operations-guide/master/create_genesis_block_channel_tx.sh | bash -s
Since the genesis block is available, now we can create the orderer image using tearup-docker-peers.sh. This script also creates all the peers and cli containers tools:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanesbarbosa/fabric-ca-operations-guide/master/tearup-docker-peers.sh | bash -s


After the step 5 I am ready to create the channel. Therefore I use the following command to use the cli-org1 container:

docker exec -it cli-org1 bash -c ""export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin/msp; peer channel create -c mychannel -f /tmp/hyperledger/assets/mychannel.tx -o orderer1-org0:7050 --outputBlock /tmp/hyperledger/assets/mychannel.block --tls --cafile /tmp/hyperledger/org1/peer1/tls-msp/tlscacerts/tls-0-0-0-0-7052.pem""


At this point I get the error:

Error: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error validating channel creation transaction for new channel 'mychannel', could not successfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  /Channel/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied


When I want to clean up everything for a fresh start I just execute:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanesbarbosa/fabric-ca-operations-guide/master/teardown-docker.sh | bash -s


Fixing Attempts


I always try a new attempt with a fresh set of crypto materials and images, so I always run the step 6 from the Reproducing the error section before trying again;
I create the channel at the step 4 as the admin of the organization;
I make sure the orderer has the TLS root signing certificate listed (everybody is using the same CA for TLS certs);
The environment variable ORDERER_GENERAL_LOGLEVEL is set to ""debug"" at the orderer image, so that I can have more detailed errors;
I tried to sign the channel creation transaction (mychannel.tx) before issuing the command peer channel create to make sure it was not a lack of signature, but the error mentions a /Channel/Application group policy, that in this case is an Implicit Meta type, where the rule is ""ANY Admins"";


    Organizations:

    # Policies defines the set of policies at this level of the config tree
    # For Application policies, their canonical path is
    #   /Channel/Application/<PolicyName>

            Type: ImplicitMeta
            Rule: ""ANY Admins""",hyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledgerhyperledger-fabric-ca,,Hanes,"Hi Hanes, that error clearly suggests that you are using an identity which is not an admin to issue the channel creation. I would check the contents of /tmp/hyperledger/org1/admin/msp. Decode certificates in that folder (openssl x509 -in /route/to.crt -text -noout), in particular signcerts contents, and if you have several certs placed in that folder, would be a good idea to recreate the network deleting all that content first.

                Hi @jfc, thanks for the help!  I checked the identity of the cert before for the admin of org1 at .../org1/admin/msp/signcerts/cert.pem. This is the same cert registered as one of the admins for org1 at .../org1/msp/admincerts/org1-admin-cert.pem.  The CA issuer of org1's admin cert is rca-org1. Therefore, for the admin-org1 to be recognized, I need to have the rca-org1 root certificate inside the orderer at the .../org0/orderer/msp/cacerts/ directory. I have put this certificate. Am I missing something?

Looked around many resources online but none is for Swift",iosswiftblockchainhyperledger-sawtooth,,L.William,"Keychain services can do everything you are trying to do without any external libraries, look at SecKeyCreateRandomKey, SecKeyCreateWithData and SecKeyCreateSignature. The only problematic part is to convert it to the correct format.

                Yes you can and I am betting that's what the library is using internally. There is nothing different from other key types, you only have to set  kSecAttrKeyType: kSecAttrKeyTypeECSECPrimeRandom, kSecAttrKeySizeInBits: 256. The only complicated thing is the conversion from external bytes because you have to understand the format in which keys are stored. github.com/agens-no/EllipticCurveKeyPair/blob/master/Sources/… is a good starting point.

Concatenation of unsigned char array in C,"2 years, 10 months ago","2 years, 10 months ago","I try to add a nonce to my blockchain program. But when I test a program performance by trying to repeat the result (I need to be able to do to verify my chain), I do not get an identical result.

First I have a function which transform a structure to unsigned array pointer :

struct  Test{
    unsigned char data[4];
    unsigned char nonce[4];
    unsigned char hash[32];
}*prev,*next; 

unsigned char *toStringTest(struct Test data)
{
    unsigned char *str=malloc(sizeof(unsigned char)*sizeof(data));
    memcpy(str,&data,sizeof(data));
    return str;
}


Then, I have a program which give me a hash and nonce:

In this function:


I concatenated unsigned char pointer from toStringTest() with unsigned char arrat nonce.
I calculated hash of this concatenation.
If the hash starts by 0x00 I save hash and nonce into next block. If not, I repeat the function.  


void hash_with_nonce(struct Test* message,struct Test* new_message){
    unsigned char nonce[4]; //number only used once
    unsigned char buffer[32];
    while(1){
        RAND_bytes(nonce, 4); //this function puts 4 cryptographically strong pseudo-random bytes into nonce. 

        unsigned char* str=toStringTest(*message); 

        int len = sizeof(unsigned char)*sizeof(*str)+sizeof(unsigned char)*sizeof(nonce);
        unsigned char* message_with_nonce = malloc(len);  
        memcpy(message_with_nonce,str,sizeof(*str));
        memcpy(message_with_nonce+sizeof(unsigned char)*sizeof(*str),nonce,sizeof(nonce));
        //I concatenated toStringTest(*message) with nonce

        SHA256(message_with_nonce, sizeof(message_with_nonce), buffer); //calculation of hash

        free(message_with_nonce);   
        unsigned char var[1] = {0x00}; //rule for nonce decision, I want what hash start by 0x00
        if((int *)var[0] == (int *)buffer[0]){ 
            memcpy(new_message->hash,buffer, 32); 
            memcpy(new_message->nonce, nonce,sizeof(nonce));
            return;
        }
    }

}


This is my main:

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    unsigned char hash[32];

    prev=malloc(sizeof(struct Test));
    RAND_bytes(prev->data, 4);
    RAND_bytes(prev->nonce, 4);
    SHA256("""",sizeof(""""),prev->hash);

    next=malloc(sizeof(struct Test));
    RAND_bytes(next->data, 4);
    //I just have filled this block with random data  

    hash_with_nonce(prev,next);


    unsigned char* str=toStringTest(*prev); 

    int len = sizeof(unsigned char)*sizeof(*str)+sizeof(unsigned char)*sizeof(next->nonce);
    unsigned char* message_with_nonce = malloc(len);  

    memcpy(message_with_nonce,str,sizeof(*str));
    memcpy(message_with_nonce+sizeof(unsigned char)*sizeof(*str),next->nonce,sizeof(next->nonce));
    SHA256(message_with_nonce, sizeof(message_with_nonce), hash);
}


prev and next are just 2 blocks which I use to check if function hash_with_nonce is working.

A problem is that the unsigned char hash[32] of the main is not the identical to next->hash. SHA256() and RAND_bytes() are openssl functions.  

To check if 2 hashs are same, I have this function:

void PrintHex(unsigned char data[], int size) 
{
    unsigned char tmp[size];
    for (int i=0; i<size; i++)
    { 
        sprintf(tmp, ""%02x"",data[i]); 
        printf(""%s"", tmp);
    }
    printf(""\n"");
}",cblockchain,"Mar 27, 2020 at 0:52",,"Just a tip, sizeof(unsigned char) is guaranteed to equal 1 so you can drop that from all your calculations.  It just clutters up the code.

                sizeof(*str) That gives you sizeof(unsigned char). It does not give you the size of the malloc memory.

                You can't get it from str. You need to keep track of that in a seperate variable. Though in this case you know it is sizeof(struct Test).

                (int *)var[0] is undefined behavior. No, you can't do that. That's not easy way, that' wrong way. Please create an minimal reproducible example. What is prev? What is next? that the unsigned char hash[32] of the main is not the identical to new->hash - how do you check that? Where is new->hash, it's nowhere in the code you presented. I do not understand your code - what is your code trying to do? Can you add comments explaining what is going on? Please fix the sizeof(*str).

                No there isn’t. That’s the whole point of the exercise. It’s hard to mine that is why it makes the whole thing secure. Otherwise people could change data easily.

This package would work along with existing backend to generate identity, participate in validation of transaction, and store a copy of chain within their device.  Later I am planning to use pluggable encryption based on developer’s need for enhanced security. 

Keeping in mind of the best consensus as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant but PBFT/BFT has resource intensive PoW to do consensus which phones can't be, I am planning to implement PBFT based on technique explained in “Elastico” paper (review/summary is attached here [1]). 

This is just an initial idea rolling in my mind for few hours now. I need to realise the feasibility this technique inside a mobile phone to form a network. 

[1] https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2018/03/paper-review-secure-sharding-protocol.html

Why do you want to build this

This package would help devs to integrate features of blockchain to their centralised app stack without rebuilding their backend. Talking about application part, consider situations which involve decision making and forming opinions, supply chain management, data provenance (integrating with IPFS)

Development of the plugin will take some real effort and time.
Not having done any serious feasibility study on the project but I believe this plugin will be useful for a longer run. 
 If there are some suggestions based on your experience in plugin development, pl share it here.",flutterblockchain,,Nidhin Mahesh A,"Folks on Ethereum Stack Exchange can provide a better view to this question.

                The peer starts and it stops suddenly. the error above comes up saying transport is closing and the peer stops as well. any way to fix this ?

Shutdown machine while inserting data stops the network,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60001367/shutdown-machine-while-inserting-data-stops-the-network,0,0,35,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05e6bef56c616ed9f254844b17b28df9?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG,"Jan 31, 2020 at 9:41",700,Riki95,https://stackoverflow.com/users/11754876/riki95,Shutdown machine while inserting data stops the network,3 years ago,3 years ago,"I have my network running with 3 machines, each one with:


1 orderer
1 peer
1 ca
1 Node.Js client


They are deployed on AWS and a load balancer correctly distributes the requests to the 3 different clients.
The clients are not using discovery service, it is disabled.

Client1 only contacts orderer1 and peer1 and ca1, and so on and so forth for the others.
I want to try the high availability of Hyperledger so when I am inserting data I shutdown a machine, let's suppose machine1, and others should continue the execution.

What happens is that while the machine is down, the network stops the execution. The clients are not moving at all (they do not crash, just stop).
When I bring up the machine again, I see errors coming but it continues the execution now.
It seems like there are calls to machine 1 suspended but they recover as soon as the machine is up.

What I want is that if machine1 goes down, the requests to it are rejected and machine 2-3 continue the execution.
How to obtain it?

[EDIT] Additional information: I have inserted some logs in the client, especially in my endpoint for creation of transactions. Like this:

console.log('Starting Creation')
await contract.submitTransaction(example)
console.log('Creation done')
res.send(200)


Let me also say that this rows are encapsulated in an error handler, so that if any error occurs, I encapsulate the error.
But I get no error, I just get the first print done and the submitTransaction working for a lot of time, never receiving answers.

It seems like it tries to deliver request to orderer but orderer is not online.

When I bring down an orderer with docker service scale orderer1=0 (since I am using services with docker swarm), the orderer leader knows in the logs that he went offline. Also, if I bring the orderer up again, a new election starts.

This seems correct, in fact the problem only happens when I shutdown the machine, closing the connection in a non-friendly way.",hyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledgerraft,"Jan 31, 2020 at 13:20",,"What errors are you seeing on the 2 clients which are still running when you stop machine1?   Or are you seeing errors in the clients which are calling via the load balancer?

                Here's one of my latest example code github.com/arsulegai/produce-consume/blob/master/… . For python you could check the cookiejar example as well github.com/danintel/sawtooth-cookiejar/blob/master/… . Note that both of these uses devmode consensus engine for development purposes.

Hyperledger Fabric 2.0 adds null character \u0000,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59989140/hyperledger-fabric-2-0-adds-null-character-u0000,0,0,281,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/323551a542938453d7761023f9b95c4b?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Jan 30, 2020 at 15:18",42,raf,https://stackoverflow.com/users/4671950/raf,Hyperledger Fabric 2.0 adds null character \u0000,3 years ago,3 years ago,"I have a strange situation happening when I create a new state. I've adapted the comercial paper smart contract, and I'm using the State and StateList abstractions.

I have simple chaincode to create an asset called log:

async createLog(ctx, loggerName, logId, ...) {
    //Check if client is a Logger

        let log = Log.createInstance(loggerName, logId, logOriginalTimestamp, idAudit, typeAuditID, auditText, auditUtilUPN, auditHostIP, processo, CuditMCcCdress);

        // Add the log to the list of all similar commercial papers in the ledger world state
        await ctx.LogList.addLog(log);


        ...
}


I create a composite key with loggerName and logId. 

class Log extends State {

    constructor(obj) {
        super(Log.getClass(), [obj.loggerName, obj.logId]);
        Object.assign(this, obj);
    }


I add the logs with the command:

peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050 --channelID mychannel --name logs -c '{""function"":""org.Log:createLog"", ""Args"":[""1"",""1""]}' --waitForEvent


But apparently, Fabric adds a null character on the beginning of the key, which I can check on CouchDB:

{
 ""id"": ""\u0000org.loglist\u0000\""1\""\u0000\""1\""\u0000"",
 ""key"": ""\u0000org.loglist\u0000\""1\""\u0000\""1\""\u0000"",
 ""value"": {
  ""rev"": ""1-c153101fc7cb0d5c363f893857ac221a""
 },
 ""doc"": {
  ""_id"": ""\u0000org.loglist\u0000\""1\""\u0000\""1\""\u0000"",
  ""_rev"": ""1-c153101fc7cb0d5c363f893857ac221a"",
...
  ""key"": ""\""1\"":\""1\"""",
  ""logId"": ""1"",
...
  ""~version"": ""CgMBAwA=""
 }
}


When I'm querying the object, I get an error: 

Error: first character of the key [org.Log""1""""1""] contains a null character which is not allowed


Which makes sense, because effectively there are null characters in several places. Why?",hyperledger-fabricblockchain,,raf,"I believe these are the composite key component delimiters, so splits the key into the composite key components.

                I would have to use the query methods to get a state from a composite key, then? @david_k

                That's one way to do it, I'm sure it would be possible to query couch directly and handle the returned information, it's just going via the chaincode query apis does it for you.

I have a requirement to disable categories, and when I do that I need to remove the category reference from the product object, to do that I need to separately update each product is there a way to update the products as a batch? The final objects after update should look something like below.

                Is this real data?  I ask because if not, why not just start over using the data format you want?  There's no built-in concept of a ""batch"" update.  Given you will need to update your chaincode, you could implement the logic to read the current category record, loop though the products creating new records and deleting the product from categories in the ""Init"" method

                Hi Serge and welcome.  Your question is interesting and we would like to help.  Unfortunately, the diagram is not fully readable: I could read Owner, Context, User, Money, Wallet, but not the las class, nor the association labels, nor the cardinality. Could you please take a more precise photo, make a bigger schema, or better model using some digital tool (if needed online, such as for example umlet.com/umletino/umletino.html )

I'm implementing in Java.To make it possible we need to create Runtime Environment for executing smartcontract using java. Can anyone help me out on how to go about??

I have an interface:

public interface smartcode{
    public void insert(/*asset related arguments*/){}
}


Every user has to implement the above interface for writing their smartcontract. So many user will be inserting their details by implementing this interface at the same time. For this to happen I have to assign each user's insert request to a thread(in Java). We have to send the request code snippets to another java code where this insert codes have to be assigned to java threads. 


  My question is how to assign this each user insert request(which is java code) to a Runnable task being executed by a thread??",javamultithreadingblockchain,"Dec 25, 2019 at 6:17",,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                What have you tried so far? What is stopping you from creating a runnable using your interface smartcode as a runnable/callable? And executing it in a thread? Should it be a thread or can it be a task?

Returned values aren't valid, did it run Out of Gas? You might also see this error if you are not using the correct ABI for the contract you are retrieving data from, requesting data from a block number that does not exist, or querying a node which is not fully synced.

I have rerun truffle migrate --reset and used the address generated as the TODO_LIST_ADDRESS but I am still getting the error above

Anyone encountered this before and knows how to solve it? Thanks

Or can't we?,"3 years, 3 months ago","3 years, 3 months ago","What conventional databases can we use to store blockchain data? Or can't we?
I have a question regarding the statement ""the Blockchain is the database"": if I were to store a table with emails and ages, I can pick a DB like MySQL. I thought blockchain data is nothing special except every record refers to the hash of another, something like:

block 1: {email: ""foo"", age: 5, previousHash: ""xyzxyz...""}
block 2: {email: ""bar"", age: 9, previousHash: ""abcabc...""}


Questions:
Can we not simply use a MySQL DB, with columns (email, age, previousHash)?
2. Of course blockchain design should not be editable or deletable. Does this mean that if we use MySQL, we must not expose a web API endpoint for users to edit? (i.e. the admin on the server can still edit & delete) ?
3. Follow-up on question 2: are there currently databases already that are simply ""insertable & readable only (NOT allow edit/delete)""?

                blockchain is a data structure, it can be stored however you want.

                Thanks. It's crazy difficult to find a clear explanation like yours. Do you also know how we can implement code that allows me to check if a record is consistent to that that in all (or at least 51% times all) other copies? @JBaczuk

                @JBaczuk, I agree it would be a bad idea. Essentially, I'm asking: what do we need to do to be confident that a record I am reading from one computer node is consistent with the clones on other nodes? More specifically, do I get record first, then check its consistency next? Or do I build a system that guarantees all nodes clone records properly first, then by the time I read, I can simply trust what I read is legit?

                That's correct except you are missing the part where nodes validate the data that was hashed. They do not blindly accept whatever data they receive based on the hash alone. If the transactions are invalid, missing proper signatures, or any of the other agreed upon consensus rules, then the nodes reject the new block, and the miner just wasted their resources mining that new block. Miners would quickly realize this is a waste of money or try to fork to a new chain.

                With that said it is often not a good idea to sort on chain(Using the EVM).  Typically it is more cost effective to sort off chain.  If I am understanding your example properly I would solve it by creating an array(public) of all addresses and a mapping of address => contribution.  Then off chain I would call to get the value of the array then for each entry, get the contribution and sort accordingly.  Hope this helps.

What already being tried :
1) Periodic increasing counter for increasing nonce for each transaction and binding it with singing message. 
2 Getting last pending nonce and using it for next transaction (But it is not helping since if we want several trasnaction , each calling 3 different Smart contract at a time, apprently ends up in one of two above error only).

I have tried changing org1MSP to org2MSP etc. and explorer successfully show only relevant peers. I am having a hard time trying to figure out why explorer can not parse successfully all orgs.
Any leads would be appreciated!",hyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledgerhyperledger-explorer,,StamGR,"you need CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT in all the peers that you want to see in explorer.

                One quick check can be to see if validators are not peering with each other. There's a known defect around max peering connections. Please set the parameter ""--maximum-peer-connectivity"" defined here sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/1-2/cli/… to a maximum value. Hope this will solve your issue.

I'm a beginner blockchain developper with some experience in Hyperledger Sawtooth and cryptography based algorithms. When i searched for the problem, i saw that there are some possibilities like running code in a Trusted Execution environment ( Intel SGX for example ) or embed a private key in the code to - in addition of client transaction signing - prove that the measures were realized with my app ( And not someone faking the data and sending it with curl or something ). But those solutions are not exactly convenient in my case.",cryptographyblockchainhyperledgersmartcontractshyperledger-sawtooth,,Adam Mabrouk,"What have you found so-far. Are talking about trusting the transmission from some 'oracle' to your frontend to then submit on the blockchain, or your phone app submitting right to the validator?

                Cryptography is the way to go. We were using Diffie Hellman (see doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/encryption-and-cryptography/…) and library for decrypting in the REST-API app we created which submitted the transactions to the verifier for updating the data on the chain. We also used ZKSNARK for the actual content of exchanges.

                Thank you for your response,but i just don't see how Zero knowledge proof could fit in this case, because i'm trying to send along with the transaction, a proof that the measurments were executed by the sensors in the appropriate mobile phone ( Kind of like a hardware signature ). A simple use case will be an app where you are paid to share sensitive informations about your location, and i'm assuming that the user have a way to know the private key which is embedded in his client App, what will prevent him for creating a mock application and send false data to the rest api routes ?

I have tried adding a few more elements in the transaction but it still doesn't change.

This is Program.cs file

class Program

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string[] genesisTransaction = { ""This is genesis transaction"", ""Satoshi sent 10 bitcoins to Teufik"" };

        Console.Write(""Genesis block: "");
        Console.WriteLine(genesisBlock.GetBlockHash());
        Console.Write(""First block: "");
        Console.WriteLine(firstBlock.GetBlockHash());
    }
}


This is Block class

class Block
{
    private int blockHash;
    private int previousHash;
    private string[] transactions;

    public Block(int previousHash, string[] transactions)
    {
        this.previousHash = previousHash;
        this.transactions = transactions;
        object[] contents = { transactions.GetHashCode(), previousHash };
        blockHash = contents.GetHashCode();
    }

    public int GetBlockHash() => blockHash;
    public int GetPreviousHash() => previousHash;

                I see, thank you but how I can make it external? I mean considering a code, the code is valid. What do you suggest to change? Should I override GetHashCode() method?

                You should build an actual hashing mechanism that hashes the contents, like a blockchain requires. You can’t override the method for an object[] nor should you since it might be confusing. Just create a method that does the hashing.

https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain/howto?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-smart-contracts#ibp-console-smart-contracts-connect-to-SDK
to deploy a smart contract from my local network to IBM Blockchain Platform. Everything went smoothly until step four. I got an error indicating that something is wrong with my container.
I googled for a while and the most promising answer inferring that there might be some problems on web docker.
Here is the description for the error:
An error occurred during instantiation.
grpc payload is empty: error starting container: error starting container: Post http://localhost:2375/build?t=dev-jdoe-papercontract-0.0.4-c9f772dd033af7a0d2fa0b7aafb268a2f2d8045143cb4344d3356fbe72999ee0: Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Failed to pull ibmblockchain/fabric-javaenv:amd64-v1.4.1: API error (404): pull access denied for ibmblockchain/fabric-javaenv, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
This is what it looks like on my screen:

It would be rather helpful if someone can tell me how to fix it. Thanks a lot in advance.

a little update: I tried to use JS instead of Java to write the smart contract, the same error popped out during the instantiating step.",blockchainhyperledgeribm-blockchainchaincode,"Nov 7, 2020 at 18:17",Cena,"At this time Java chaincode isn't supported on IBM Blockchain platform.

                I don't think it's the problem of language at this moment, because I used JS and the same error jumps out. Maybe some other things goes off the road?

                for java you got this message Failed to pull ibmblockchain/fabric-javaenv:amd64-v1.4.1 and that is the indicator that java chaincode is not supported.

I tried it this way and also with the HextoByteArray Method from Nethereum, but both didn't work.

strAccKey = ""40bbe961e04f7e83596d1b559b9ec7022b3eac8512077938a95dfba7657a8e90"";

                Convert it from ""hex string"" back to bytes, not to a new string. Find the opposite of .ToHex.

                If you took an array of bytes, converted it to hex, then back to an array of bytes, then converted the final array of bytes to a string through UTF8 decoding, and the text is not readable, it was not readable to start with.

The problem is that we want to implement blockchain in our IoT platform and all implementations and samples that I found are focus in financial environments (bitcoins).

Reading how it works I asume, that we will create a block for every message of every device. But I don't know if it is the best approach because we have a lot of vehicles (around 1000) that send us their position every 5 second (17280 messages by vehicle in a day). I'm worried about the volumen of the data. I'm not sure if it is that how we have to used it, or is better to create a block with a compilation of all information of every vehicle in a day.

I hope that you can understand my question because my English is not very good :)

                Yeah exactly. But that admin card  is limited for that network only. What Im trying to tell you is I created my own network with multi peers. So it makes no sense for using ./createPeerAdminCard.sh script for this network. It will create card for the predefined network of single org right??

                you have a little confusion in understanding the concepts. the ""Peer Admin Card"" can be used to deploy multiple ""Business Networks"". ""Business Network"" is just another name for ""smart contract"" or ""chaincode"" or decentralized application. you use ""Peer Admin Card"" that you created using ./createPeerAdminCard.sh to deploy Business Network (bna files or apps) into the network of peers you have created. the ""Network admin card"" is something different, it is specific to the Business Network application used for management.

The problem I'm running into is that sometimes the server needs to start a container to manage user connections, and the user starts their docker container on login as well. If the server and the user both logout at the same time, it may try to delete a container twice. likewise if the user and the server start a docker container at the same time, we would have two copies of the same docker container running. I've used a couple semaphores and a lock to solve the problem on paper, but I'm wondering if I create two agent objects using: 

agent_obj_1 = agent.objects.get(wallet_name=request.session[""wallet""])
agent_obj_2 = agent.objects.get(wallet_name=request.session[""wallet""]) 
agent_obj_1.start()
agent_obj_2.start()


where each agent has a lock and semaphore local variable, and I lock the mutex on agent_obj_1, can I still lock agent_obj_2 because they are different instances? or can I not lock agent_obj_2 because it is only a different referance pointing to the same object in memory as agent_obj_1? ie. do agent_obj_1 and agent_obj_2 share a lock instance variable defined in the __init__() method? here is the relevant part of my agent class in models.py for reference 

class agent(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    seed = models.CharField(max_length=32)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    wallet_name = models.CharField(max_length=150)

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.sem = Semaphore(value=2)
        self.create = Lock()
        super(agent, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def start(self):
        self.sem.acquire()
        self.create.acquire()
        proc = self.find_or_create()
        self.create.release()


edit: To clarify, the agent object has already been saved to the django database using:

agent_obj = agent(user, email, ...)
agent_obj.save()

                They're two instances. But even if they weren't, Django is usually served by multiple processes; there you can definitely count on separate data.

                Can you provide some more details about your operating environment. What OS are you using and what version ? what version of the extension are you using, I am assuming 1.0.4 as this seems to be a common problem with that release. You could try using a different version of the extension. If you right click on the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension in the extensions tab you can try installing an older version, for example 1.0.3. Note that you should have either node 8 or node 10 installed. Node 6 will not work.

                What specifically are you trying to validate? The result will always be a hexadecimal encoding of some bytes. If you want to validate that you have hexadecimal, that's easy (optional leading 0x followed by an even number of digits in [0-9a-fA-F]). If you want to check for a valid Ethereum transaction, you'll have to decode the data, process the RLP encoding, and validate the values.

When searching around I cannot find a solution to the problem, I have contacted blockcypher but they never respond. Here is the code im using to sign the transaction, does anyone know why its giving me this error?

                Why not just use the BitcoinJS library to fully build the transaction and only use blockcypher to broadcast the signed tx. You could follow this tutorial: medium.com/@aniketdivekar/… and then use sochain.com/api#get-unspent-tx to get the UTXO's

But when I run the following command:

./configtxlator proto_decode --input blockfile_000000 --type common.Block


I get this error:

How can I solve this issue?",hyperledger-fabrichyperledgerblockchain,,Leonardo Carraro,"Is your goal to decode the entire ledger or do you just want to be able to decode individual blocks? configtxlator will not be able to decode the block file (which contains many blocks); you'll need to fetch individual blocks and decode each one.

                @RodolfoLeal is absolutely correct, adding orgs to an existing network is absolutely non-trivial. Even starting a network with multiple orgs requires all of them to be mentioned in the configtx.yaml file.

It says on the website that new HttpService() defaults to localhost:8545 which is what my testrpc is running on. I have also set the internet permission in the manifest.

//imports etc
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_home_screen);

I think the problem can be in the fact the localhost at your running env is not the same localhost with environment of testrpc. For example, if you use Virtual Machine, localhost will point to that machine but testrpc is likely to be running on your host machine

Following the instructions here, I've installed blockchain.info using npm like so:

npm install --save blockchain.info

The installation works properly and the respective folder exists in the project's ""node_modules"" folder.

However, I don't seem to get where or how I have to set the require('blockchain.info') statement. When I put it in the project's app.js file, it generates a <script> tag with src=""src/blockchain.info.js"". But this file doesn't exist. What am I doing wrong?

I've got the following setup:


Node.js 6.10.3
npm 3.10.10
aurelia 0.30.0",javascriptnode.jsaureliarequireblockchain,"Jun 21, 2017 at 14:54",,"I think you're misunderstanding things... blockchain is a server-side library that works on NodeJS. Aurelia is a client-side framework that works on Browser. RequireJS is a module loader. require() is the syntax to load modules on NodeJS and has nothing related to RequireJS

I try to read the document ,but I didn't the point.
My Scenario is I want to make a small voting system using Block-chain with the implement of Fabric.
I try to install the Fabric v0.6 directly (clone from GIT and use) in my VM local Server without any help of Docker or vagrant ,and successful done it. 
I am also able to run default of peer, membersrvc and some sample example in fabric. by using Postman, all is working fine for me.

Now I want to add more peers(both validating and non-validating) to form a network. Come to this point I try many option is Fabric default document, and some tip is here ,but I still cannot make it. I really appreciate if someone can help me with this part.
- I really want to clear that if It possible or not to form a network using Server directly without the help of Docker or Vagrant. Since some people said that it's not working and some say it works. (Hope to get clear answer here) 
    If can. Could you guide me in it operation (with picture is best)?
    If cannot. Could you guide me the way to make it ?


I try to follow the document of fabric, they are using docker. I try to follow there steps ,but it still not working for me. I still confuse why they are using docker (container) and again they are using vagrant, as my understand both are virtual environment ? ""I hope that someone could pave a way for me this part""
Especially with IP address of docker. To connect multiple peer with one VM, it need multiple IPs. I still cannot find a way to easily change IP address of Docker yet?
Sometimes I successful install vagrant in fabric/devenv ,but While I try to access to hyperledger fabric. I cannot find any resource files.


My conclusion is that I hope someone can help me in steps ordered on how to make a network in Fabric with easy understand ways.

                it should be displayed in terminal if you enable CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG when you start a peer. and another thing you might need to check is how you get docker daemon running. The docker native for mac starts the docker remote api with sock file then you might need to mount /var/run/docker.sock into you docker container

                what about after deploying the chaincode? Basically, after deploying, Invoke function will be executed then it stores the transaction. what i was wondering is deploying might went through but the transaction might not. So I just want to make sure that all operation went through

I follow the tutorial of Eris
https://monax.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/

All is good. I'm successful to create,  instantiate a Blockchain called simplechain, and deploy a smart contract called idi (exactly in tutorial)

Now I want to create another chain, called simplechain3 so that 2 chains can run at the same time, and then, I want to deploy this contract idi or another contract (if I want to create the new one) this new chain simplechain3.
I can create new simplechain3 but I cannot deploy this contract or another contract to this new chain simplechain3. It always aims at the old chain simplechain.

Here are commands I typed:
eris chains make --account-types=Root:3,Full:2 simplechain3

eris chains start simplechain3 --init-dir simplechain3_full_000 --ports=1428,47000,47001

(I must create new ports for this chain. If not, the error will appears because the port 46657 was already occupie by the old simplechain)

All is good, I checked it by this command
eris chains ls
Output:
*CHAIN            ON     CONTAINER ID     DATA CONTAINER

simplechain      *      e3868c82b0       38dd9d37fa*

With this command:
docker ps

Output

Could you help me solve this problem? How to deploy the contract to another chain? I've already tested it with another contract, it is the same.

The content of the file epm.yaml is in the tutorial
https://monax.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/#step-3-2-fixup-your-epm-yaml

And the content of the contract is in the tutorial, too
https://monax.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/#step-3-1-make-a-contract-for-idi

For the another contract, the same problems appears.

I work in Linux Ubuntu 16.04, Eris 0.12.0, docker 1.12.3

The contract is deployed with success using this command above  The chains simplechain3 has 2 full node. Maybe the command eris pkgs do of the current version eris 0.12 donot take it into account?

There are many questions on here about setting up pure-JS diffie hellman in place of SSL. All of them are roundly refuted, and I think I understand why (although I completely disagree that there's no value in DH-keyed symmetric encryption for the millions of sites which are not going to be implementing full SSL anytime soon either way).

Anyway, question is this: it seems as though the only preventative reason JS DH wouldn't work is that you lose authentication so you're still subject to man-in-the-middle. All the myriad other issues flow from attempts to resolve this one. 

But what if you used a blockchain as a certificate authority? The process would then be 


Form DH key
encrypt any handshake string with known public key from blockchain
encrypt this verify string with DH key
if handshake string received back, authentication verifies and DH is as secure as SSL DH


Edit: didn't mean to imply DH was symmetric, adjusted for clarity",javascriptencryptionblockchaindiffie-hellman,"Nov 8, 2016 at 16:11",,"Yay blockchain hype train. Great that you're trying to figure that out but maybe you don't want to use JavaScript?

                the problem is still not solved. Its also impossible to open a blockchain service. I get something like; 'sorry but due to overwhelming demand we are currently at maximum capacity for our service... .... return to the bluemix dashboard and delete this service instance.' The problem is I cant delete it.

What does ""Must supply username for chaincode"" mean. Has anyone faced a similar issue while running with security enabled on a local network ?

UPDATE:
So, I changed the enrillId to user_type1_xxx , now ""No Membership users found.."" message doesn't come anymore. But I'm getting a connection refused error when the user is trying to register.

                Ok, there are a couple of issues going on here... First, the $agent = ... line is terminated by a : in your code, change it to a semi-colon ;. Next it seems you have error_reporting turned off, you will have to turn it on. Check this link for pointers on how to turn it on properly: Turning Error Reporting On. Next, it seems that you are using the json_decode return value as an array when it actually returns an object. You can force it to return an array using the 2nd param like this: json_decode($result, true)

                Code doesn’t make any difference - I am purely wondering from a theoretical stand point what makes a reverted and successful transaction look different to a block explorer / on chain

Any idea? Do you know if there is any working example or did you experience similar issue?

However, the write function only seems to work when called within an onclick function, and not when called within a useEffect hook that is triggered when an image changes.
Here's the relevant code:


When I click the ""Write"" button, the function is called and the write is successful. But when the write function is called within the useEffect hook that is triggered when the imageUrl changes, no data is written and I don't receive any error message.
I'm not sure what's causing this behavior and would appreciate any help or suggestions.
I've tried moving the write function call to different lifecycle methods in the component, but it still doesn't work when triggered by the imageUrl change.
I've tried logging the value of the imageUrl variable within the useEffect hook, and it does change as expected.
I expected the write function to be called and for the data to be written to the smart contract when the imageUrl changes.",reactjsreact-hooksblockchain,Jan 16 at 10:21,skyboyer,"2

Simple synchronization protocol for array of objects,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54385016/simple-synchronization-protocol-for-array-of-objects,0,2,163,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65f71218cef5ac99acbfc45fa3a9a531?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Jan 27, 2019 at 4:13","7,146",Daniel,https://stackoverflow.com/users/6398044/daniel,Simple synchronization protocol for array of objects,4 years ago,4 years ago,"I looking for a protocol or a standard suitable for the following requirements:


There is an array of objects that can be represented in JSON - as text.
We have one source of truth stored as file or files. (possible many but I looking for simplicity)
There are many clients that are trusted and do CRUD operations on these data.
A server (That can be realized by serverless architecture because it is needed only when a client requires it) that modifies these flat files on requests from clients or gives them current version of resources.




I researched some hours and have a problem because found many complicated solutions like Paxos and Raft that requires network infrastructure. 

My proposition

So I want to show my proposition and instantly ask if something similar exists and can be used in this case. Any feedback about problems with my concept will be appreciated.

Architecture.

Clients

We have many clients that can be disconnected from network, operate on local data and want to send their changes, receive changes made by other clients. 

Data Storage

We have one data storage like AWS / Dropbox / Google Drive / Hosted files, does not matter, it is important that there is no access to such advanced and powerful tools like casandra. There are two files: current data - it can be serialized JSON or SQLite file and logs it is a file with the history of all operations sorted by timestamp.

Point of access

We have one point to access to this data. Serverless unit with the following tasks: receive local logs from the client, merge them with global logs, process them to update global current data, send to client instruction about a local modification that hi should apply.



Processing

Let's consider the following scenario. A client modifies local data and adds any modification to local logs.

Synchronization means. That
1) A client is sending local logs to point of access (server). The server creates empty .lock file to prevent modification from other points of access. If the file was existing before, synchronization is refused. The server looks for the date of the last synchronization saved in the local log. Then download logs from storage and gets any lines from the date of the last synchronization to now. Server mixing them, and calculating two things: a) how to update global current data, b) how to update local current data of this client. Then the server download global data, apply modification. Send local modification instructions to the client. And removes .lock file. Client applies modifications modifying local state, remove local logs and save to them a date of the last synchronization.

Exceptions / Merging

Now image that two clients deleted the same item. It should be deleted. Id is randomized, so two clients can't create two elements with the same Id. If anyway would be created, the second is valid and his creation is changed to update. If two clients update the same resource then we should look at his structure. I mentioned about JSON representation. So it is a collection of keys and values. The following strategy should be applied:

First version         {a:1, b:2, c:3}
Update form client 1: {a:4, b:2, c:3}
Update from client 2: {a:1, b:5, c:3}
Merged version        {a:4, b:5, c:3}


Because of the date of last modification is calculated for any property independently. 

When during processing exceptions stop the server and .lock will be not deleted, then the system stops synchronization and require manual fixing.

My questions:


where can I find open source solutions similar to presented one?
are there any protocols, standards that should I learn?
what should I type in Google / Duckduck to find it?


Related topic from 2009.


  Client-server synchronization pattern / algorithm?



there was svn, cvs recommended


but because of CVS was replaced by SVN, SVN by GIT should I consider using GIT to synchronization like this? On wikipedia Version Control systems are considered as ""requiring much overhead"".

Considering differences between blockchain and chain of blocks I understand that blockchain can't be applied here.",gitsvnsynchronizationblockchaindata-synchronization,"Jan 27, 2019 at 5:00",,"You don't mention what you think should happen in the case of merge conflicts.  As for ""serverless"", there absolutely is a server, something grants access to your ""one source of truth"".  If you mean the server is restricted to complete replacement of the dataset on command and want to know how to serialize command access, you'll have to specify exactly what operations are possible on this one thing you don't want to call a server.  But none of this is on-topic here, maybe try the software engineering exchange at a guess.

                I believe you'll find that both gpu.js and tensorflow.js are somewhat limited in their logical operations (ie, AND, OR, XOR, etc) on integers.  For example, the tf.logicalAnd operates on a tensor element of true/false rather than a binary integer.  And the gpu.js math functions lack logicals.  This makes calculating SHA256 via Javascript/GPU somewhat challenging to say the least...

I came across issues with the amount of transactions processed per block (or per second - as they can be exchangeable on the Clique context).

I notice, though, that if I reduce the block frequency (let us say to 1 second) and set the gas limit to a tremendously high number (let us say 10 MM), I will be able to fit a lot of transactions per block.

There is my question there: there must have some drawback on this rationale. I suppose the processing speed (of the authority nodes) and the network latency (to propagate and synchronise the blocks throughout all the nodes) are two crucial—that is if they are any really. Am I right? What would be the other bottlenecks?

                Yes, It was because I use Timestamp, so the solution is to remove the Timestamp or to use a single endorser peer

It is not running on Kubernetes with other container like peer, orderer. 
Chain code container is running on peer node after all other container have creation. 

The reason for this is to detect any deployment failure of specific version of chain code on blockchain network.

I heard that there is a way to do it by using logs of peer container. But I want to know if it can work by checking container itself.

Any comment will be appreciated.",containersblockchainhyperledgersmartcontracts,"Jul 19, 2018 at 13:47",Vit,"Add a comment

C++ server: C++ 11

When I tried to create a user issued assets on Bitshare, I need to construct a json object as one of the parameter, see instructions here: https://steemit.com/bitshares/@adinda/update-bitshares-how-to-creating-a-new-uia-asset-manually

Official API documentation here: http://docs.bitshares.org/api/wallet-api.html
Search for ""create_asset"", then you can find it!

Because I am creating a cpp server, I made a c++ version of it, I use jsoncpp for constructing json. But after testing, it reports parsing error:

        ""quote"" :

            ""amount"" : 10,
            ""asset_id"" : ""1.3.1""
        }
    },
    ""description"" : ""My fancy description"",
    ""flags"" : 511,
    ""issuer_permissions"" : 511,
    ""market_fee_percent"" : 0,
    ""max_market_fee"" : 0,
    ""max_supply"" : 10000,
    ""whitelist_authorities"" : [],
    ""whitelist_markets"" : []
}


I didn't find any char '111' in ""options"", that's why I am confused. Could anyone please offer any suggestions? I would be greatly appreciate it!



Updates:

Thanks for the suggestions, now I constructed a new json holding all the information in the original *data, see code below:

Json::Value data;
Json::Value params_new = Json::arrayValue;
params_new.append(""nathan"");
params_new.append(""SYMBOL"");
params_new.append(3);
params_new.append(options);
params_new.append({});
params_new.append(true);

data[""jsonrpc""] = 2.0;
data[""id""] = 2;
data[""method""] = ""create_asset"";
data[""params""] = params_new;

cout << ""data: "" << data << endl;
cout << ""to c_str: "" << data.toStyledString().c_str() << endl;


I sent data.toStyledString().c_str() as *data thourgh curl, now after sending it, I got followings:

                data is not valid json, it has a value called options. I'm assuming its supposed to be replaced with your variable options but that I don't see that happening anywhere...

The contracts that I am practicing on are;

contract Company is CompanyInterface {
    address public ceo;
    ...
    function setCeo(address newCeo){
        ceo = newCeo;
    }
    ...
}

contract MainCompany is CompanyInterface {
    address public ceo;
    address public lib; // address of Company contract
    ...
    function() payable external {
        if(!lib.delegatecall(msg.data)) {
          revert();
        }
    }
    ...
}


Here, I try to make myself ceo of the MainCompany. However, I couldn't figure out how to call setCeo here. As I know that when an attacker calls MainCompany.setCeo(attacker), MainCompany's fallback function should be triggered when the function (setCeo) can't be found in the MainCompany contract. However, it doesn't happen.

My approach is to create an attacker contract. In that contract, I created a function that does the following;

<addressOfMainCompany>.call.value(1)(bytes4(keccak256(""setCeo(address)"")), address(0x4b9...));


But ceo is still same. What is the correct way of changing ceo of the MainCompany here?

Ive found the csharp lib of the iota api and trying to send a transaction but got a problem i couldnt figure out without help.

Here is my code:



         private  void test()
        {

            IotaApi iotaApi = new IotaApi(""node.iotawallet.info"", 14265);
            GetNodeInfoResponse nodeInfo = iotaApi.GetNodeInfo();


            List<Transfer> transfers = new List<Transfer>();
            transfers.Add(new Transfer(""testseed"", 0, ""JUSTANOTHERTEST"", null));

        }




When i run it, i get "" Not a transfer array"" exception  on iotaApi.SendTransfer using a console application on VS2015
I traced it down to the function ""CheckTransferArray"" which is called by Sendtransfer but couldnt figure out what i was doing wrong.(information here https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.csharp/wiki/M_Iota_Lib_CSharp_Api_Utils_InputValidator_CheckTransferArray)

As i couldnt find much documentation for c# and this lib i copied the test methodes and tryed to get it working without luck.
I also noticed that the last update on github was some months ago, so my question is : 
Is there a solution or did i failed to understand something ? Or is the lib not up to date? Would realy appreciate if somebody could help me.",c#blockchain,"Sep 14, 2017 at 22:29",,"2
            
        
        
            
                
                iota.lib.csharp has not yet been updated for the hashing changes to thwart the attack found by MIT. So, at the moment, to run against public servers you'd have to use either iota.lib.js or iota.lib.java.

                Apart from that, the ""testseed"" of your sample code may not be a seed, but has to be an address (with checksum) associated to a seed.

I want to make sure that a certain document's content 


Was issued without doubt by a certain party (that owns a private key) 
Was issued at a given point in time  
Was never modified


My approach would be to just hash the document and put the hash as metadata (after OP_RETURN) in a Blockchain transaction. With Blockchain, the transaction content is signed by an organization's private key. 

Does this approach alone fulfill all three conditions mentioned above?

There's a project from MIT (http://certificates.media.mit.edu/), but they put a signed document hash on the Blockchain instead of just putting the document hash itself on the Blockchain.",hashcryptographydigital-signaturebitcoinblockchain,"Aug 9, 2016 at 22:50",,"1

                there's nothing wrong with a documents' hash, as long as you can provide non-repudiation. Of course you must be able to track the hash to its original document, timestamping...etc. I don´t have much experience with bitcoin blockchain, but signing a hash is way better that working with the document itself in some situations, yours appears to be one of them.

At this point I am however stuck as to how one would go about implementing the communication with full nodes in the network using bloomfilters as described in BIP37 from within a hybrid app. Could anyone point me in the right direction as to how this could best be implemented.

Also some concrete questions that might help me in the right direction:


Do all full nodes handle bloomfilters sent by SPV clients?
How would one connect to a bitcoin node from a cordova app? (if I'm not mistaken one will have to connect to a TCP socket of the node)

It can be compiled under go-mobile. Currently, it's under development, and in alpha mode. If that's not enough, I can find some more links and post as a full answer.

Advantage/Disadvantage between Chainlink VRF and an off-chain random number transaction performed by your server?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75141635/advantage-disadvantage-between-chainlink-vrf-and-an-off-chain-random-number-tran,0,1,41,https://i.stack.imgur.com/wEkDC.jpg?s=32&g=1,Jan 17 at 3:05,21,itsnotcryptoitscryptoe,https://stackoverflow.com/users/19212006/itsnotcryptoitscryptoe,Advantage/Disadvantage between Chainlink VRF and an off-chain random number transaction performed by your server?,1 month ago,30 days ago,"As I understand it Chainlink VRF uses the request-response approach for providing contracts with a ""trusted random number"". You (the developer) create a smart contract and inherit the Chainlink VRFConsumerBase contract, declare a storage variable that will hold your random number result, then initialize some keyhash & chainlink oracle address, and implement a function ( lets say abc() ) that calls Chainlinks ""requestRandomness()"" function. You then override the internal ""fulfillRandomness()"" function and set the returned random number on your storage variable.
Short flow:

Fund your smart contract with LINK, make a transaction call to abc()
Wait for Chainlinks Oracle to make a transaction call to your contract ""fulfillRandomness()"" and set the random number result on your storage variable.

Rather than using this approach wouldn’t it be sufficient to just write a smart contract that emits a ""RequestRandom"" Event and have a personal server running that listens for the RequestRandom event of your contract and have that server then generate a random number and make an authorized transaction to my contract to set that generated random number on it.
contract MyRandom {

    event RequestRandom(uint seed);

    address public myServerWallet;
    uint public myRandomNumber;

    constructor(address a) {
       myServerWallet = a;
    }

    function makeRandomRequest(uint seed) external {
        emit RequestRandom(seed);
    }

    function setRandomResult(uint result) external {
        require(msg.sender == myServerWallet, ""Only server may call"");
        myRandomNumber = result;
    }
}

What would be the difference between this approach vs Chainlink VRF? Am I sacrificing some type of security by using this approach?
Tried the server approach above. It does work but still curious on advantage/disadvantage.",ethereumblockchainsoliditysmartcontractschainlink,Jan 17 at 21:39,,"Think from the user's perspective. - How can I be sure your server will return indeed the random number, not the predefined one? - How can I be sure, your server will be running, listening for events, and then emitting the random numbers?

                @tenbits fully understandable concern, with dapps there is a level of trust to be created between your dapp and your user. In video games we trust the devs to use rng fairly. Additionally we can ask the same question for chainlink VRF and what makes it so that cheaper solutions cannot be considered?

                Absolutely, if your users trust your Random Number Provider and it is uptime, for sure you can use a more efficient solution. In your sample is not clear how the contract, which calls the makeRandomRequest will receive that number and proceed with the execution?

Unfortunately I am having trouble with loading the contract on the website. The code to load the contract sits in eth-info-ex/src/app.js and is as follows:
loadContract: async () => {
        const ETHINFOEX = await $.getJSON('./ETHINFOEX.json')
        //create a truffle contract - a js representation of a smart contract that allows to call functions on it
        App.contracts.ETHINFOEX = TruffleContract(ETHINFOEX)
        App.contracts.ETHINFOEX.setProvider(new Web3.providers.HttpProvide(""http://127.0.0.1:7545""));
        //console.log(ETHINFOEX)
        App.ETHINFOEX = await App.contracts.ETHINFOEX.deployed()
    },

The ETHINFOEX.json file is in the following path: eth-info-ex/build/contracts/ETHINFOEX.json
When I load the app by npm run dev I get the following output:

My function call is returning expensive gas cost on metamask,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75089016/my-function-call-is-returning-expensive-gas-cost-on-metamask,0,1,30,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/faa748bf44254d6ec5a84ac5bb63a206?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,Jan 11 at 21:07,11,Tsss,https://stackoverflow.com/users/19607309/tsss,My function call is returning expensive gas cost on metamask,1 month ago,1 month ago,"To context. I want to make a contract that receives USDC and send custom tokens to the buyer. After that, in the same call, the contract forwards those USDCs to another wallet. I have done tests, and calls. When I do it through Remix, I'm able to get it working nicely, Rate works, forward funds, everything. However, once I try to call it through Metamask, it returns me a absurd amound of gas required (10 matic) to call buyTokens(). Could someone help me find if something is wrong, or should it be this expensive?
ps: With buyTokens(), we are also calling approve() from the buyer, to approve Crowdsale to take the right amount of USDC
I have two contracts to demonstrate. First, the custom token:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import ""./MinterRole.sol"";

contract TokenMBP is ERC777P, MinterRole {

        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        address[] memory defaultOperators,
        uint256 initialSupply
    ) ERC777P(name, symbol, defaultOperators)
    {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply, """", """", """");
    }

    function mint(address account, uint256 amount, bytes memory userData, bytes memory operatorData, bytes32 proof) public onlyMinter returns (bool) {
        _mint(account, amount, userData, operatorData, proof);

Did I understand correctly? how do you think about it?

Dapp cannot jump out the traditional web2.0 technologies from html, javascript and domains to servers. It’s horrible and not decentralized.
Is there an idea to develop a browser that can interact with contract automatically?

Don’t rely on domains.
I don’t want to apply for domains which need to be certified with real-name in some country. It’s ideal to locate  dapp by ENS or contract address.

List contract content automatically. If the dapp was made with JavaScript and html then has to find an web server or ipfs to host the file. Thus leads to the
question that conflict with question 1 for the file needs a domain to locate. The best idea is  interacting with contract from contract ABI automatically. Don’t write dapp frontend at all. The frontend logic can be done by a schema in the contract.


As a summary the browser locate contract by address or ENS. Show frontend automatically from ux schema and show according operation from ABI.",blockchainsmartcontracts,,mbo,"Add a comment

                MM doesn't have a way to show the message I think. So the job should fall on bscscan. In any case you're not doing anything wrong (I just tested on other contracts and no-one show any message).

                If the tx fails they still pay a gas fee. It's possible that once failed, bscscan will show the error message on the tx page.

If it is the owner who writes it, use symmetric encryption, and only they can decode the data. If it is others who write it, use asymmetric encryption, and again, only the owner of the private key can decode the data. How does putting this in a smart contract change anything? Perhaps you can expand this question to explain the special case at hand. (In any of these cases, it's going to be off-topic for SO, but at least understanding why there's a question may help point you to the right site.)

The following is the relevant portion of the smart contract:
contract SimpleAuction {

    address payable public beneficiary;
    address payable public buyer;
    address payable public seller;

 .....

constructor(
        
        address payable _seller

        buyer = payable(highestBidder);
        seller = _seller;
        state = State.await_payment;

and auctionEnd function is:
function auctionEnd() payable public {
      
        require(!ended, ""auctionEnd has already been called."");
        ended = true;
        emit AuctionEnded(highestBidder, highestBid);
        beneficiary.transfer(highestBid);
    }

However, I am getting the following error when calling auctionEnd. The transaction has been reverted to the initial state. Note: The called function should be payable if you send value and the value you send should be less than your current balance.
Also to note the debugger points to beneficiary.transfer(highestBid); where the revert has happened. However, both beneficiary and highestBid holds the right value.

Really stange. Just observed that if I change beneficiary.transfer to seller.transfer, the transaction is successful and the eth is transferred to the seller account. But if I change it to buyer.transfer, which should ideally transfer the funds back to the buyer's account (highest bidder), the transaction is successful but the funds are not transferred. Where do they disappear? :')",blockchainethereumsolidity,"Aug 12, 2022 at 17:03",,"1

As of now I can only get an EOA to sign the transaction / vote on proposals. I was wondering if I could 'delegate' this signing power to a contract instead.
I know that contracts cant sign transactions since they have no private key however what is the best workaround for this.
For context I would like to build an app that allows users to stake Token A on contract A, which would allocate the given number of governance token to contract A (from contract B for example), then contract A could be used to vote off chain on snapshot.",blockchainethereumsolidity,"Aug 9, 2022 at 19:48",TylerH,"What happens when you try?

I am using Geth to spin up my Ethereum n/w. Till the count is 15, there is not much delay. But as i start increasing the count, it takes several minutes before it actually starts creating the accounts.
I know it has something to do with the asynchronous calls I am making. If i do it synchronously, there is no issue.
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(""ws://127.0.0.1:8545""));

const generateAccount = () => {
  const count = 30;
  let promises = []
  for (let i=0; i<count; i++) {
    promises.push(web3.eth.personal.newAccount(""Hello@12345""));

  )
  
}

But, I want to understand what exactly happening behind the scene and why it's taking so much time if the count gets bigger. My actual requirement might take the count to several 1000s of account creation concurrently. If I am giving that much count, the network freezes and block generation is also stopped. Even if I terminate the script, it doesn't restores. I have to restart the n/w to bring everything back to track. So i also want to know, what's the best approach on achieving this.

                My problem was that I used call and not delegate call. On the authorise function it checked if this the sender is the owner of the token. I splitted it to 2 contracts so its more efficient and gas fees lower. Bc if I did everything in one it was a bit very expensive and slow

I keep getting an error saying:
Error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: Cross-program invocation with unauthorized signer or writable account

I managed to deduce that the create_account call itself is what fails; I am not sure if I passed in the wrong seeds, or if my signers on the frontend/context are configured wrong (previously I was going with a Signer<'info> directly, but then following the Anchor Book article on PDAs, I turned that into an unchecked account, for better or worse.
pub fn init_collection(
    _ctx: Context<InitCollection>,
) -> Result<()> {
    msg!(""checking if account is initialized"");
    if !_ctx.accounts.col.data_is_empty() {
        msg!(""account is already initialized"");
        return Ok(());

    payer: UncheckedAccount<'info>,

    // If the account being initialized already has lamports, then
    // return them all back to the payer so that the account has
    // zero lamports when the system program's create instruction
    // is eventually called.
    let __current_lamports = new_account.lamports();
    if __current_lamports == 0 {
        // Create the token account with right amount of lamports and space, and the correct owner.
        let lamports = rent.minimum_balance(space);

        let cpi_context = anchor_lang::context::CpiContext::new(system_program.to_owned(), cpi_accounts);
        anchor_lang::system_program::create_account(cpi_context.with_signer(&[seeds_with_nonce]), lamports, space as u64, owner)?; // <== This seems to be where it's failing
    } else {

                In init_collection you add &[255] to the seeds, while you don't add that same byte in the Accounts struct. Is there any reason for this?

                @WalrusGumboot I was under an impression that's how you pass in the bump for the account. I tried passing it like that, after trying `_ctx.bumps.get(""col"").unwrap()"", but both led to the same error. Passing in nothing for the bump also doesn't affect the error, so I'm a bit confused as to what to do.

                @Reynevan can you share the init_pda method. Would clear the things that how you have utilized the method arguments. This is typical example of wrong seeds.

mapping(uint256 => Request) public requests;

struct Request {
    uint256 id;
    address CurrentOwner;
    uint256 price;

function totalAddPendingRequest() public view returns (uint256) {

   function requestToAddProperty(address _CurrentOwner,uint256 _price,string memory _details,string memory _picture

        _price,
        _details,
        _picture

    pendingRequestID++;

Now i have pendingRequestID to loop on and can return those mapping values one by one.. butt:
This is my react Code:
const [realEstateContract , setRealEstateContract] = useState({});
const [totalRequestedProperties, setTotalRequestedProperties] = useState();

// tried this as well:
// const [totalRequestedProperties, setTotalRequestedProperties] = useState(0);

console.log(realEstateContract);

  const signer = provider.getSigner()
  const RealEstateContract = new ethers.Contract(RealEstateContractAddress, RealEstateabi, signer);

  setRealEstateContract(RealEstateContract);
  pendingIdFunction();

},[])

async function pendingIdFunction() {
  await realEstateContract &&  realEstateContract.totalAddPendingRequest().then(r => {
    setTotalRequestedProperties( BigNumber.from(r._hex).toString())
  })

}

console.log(totalRequestedProperties);

Now this realEstateContract returns my contract and i get that totalRequestedProperties returns my exact number but for some reasons, my loop is not working ,, after figuring out i found that this totalRequestedProperties returns undefined first and then goes with my number , even that realEstateContract returns empty object first and then goes with my actual contract data ,, how to deal with it at first place?
This is how i am doing it:
  <div>{totalRequestedProperties}</div>
  {[...Array(totalRequestedProperties)].map((e, i) => ""faroqq"" )}

Result and Console:
i just cant get that loop , those totalrequests are fine.",javascriptreactjsblockchainsolidity,"May 11, 2022 at 7:40",,"Add a comment

I am able to compile and migrate my contracts with truffle through the cli but what I would like to achieve is to run the migrations inside my API in node js. I have been digging into truffle packages for hours but found nothing on how to do that.
What I understood is that the migrations are performed by an object called deployer and that there is a package called @truffle/deployer. The thing is I don't know how properly create one.
The alternative would be to use web3js for deployment which has a much trickier process.
has anybody performed truffle mifrations in a javascript script instead of using truffle migrate in the terminal before?",blockchainsmartcontractstruffle,,gloria00,"I don't know the solution right now, but it seems that the migration JS is in the migrate package (github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/develop/packages/migrate/…) - not in the deployer.

                that I also noticed. It says that it is used innside the migrate command in the core package. But I checked in the truffle core package and jn the index.js there is no migrate command

                The truffle command (and its params, such as migrate) is invoked from ./node_modules/.bin/truffle. The migrate param then links to a webpack module, most likely a wrapper of the package mentioned in my previous comment. As you can see in the migrate package source, it states in a comment that it's used as part of truffle migrate. My guess is that the truffle script effectively executes some of the migrate script functions in series - maybe first  needsMigrating to validate, and then runMigrations.

I have two smart contracts X and Y. The cross-contract (XSS) flow is Alice -> X -> Y.
Y transfers some tokens to X. The XSS to Y does not return how many tokens were transferred, so X needs to check its balance using ft_balance_of().
The tokens have to be transferred back to Alice.

Is it safe to transfer the entire token balance of X, as returned by ft_balance_of()? Say that Bob calls X around the same time as Alice. Since XSS on NEAR is async,can Alice get credited with Bob's funds?
Additional context
My contract X is calling ft_transfer_call() on Ref exchange (instant swap). Apparently the promise returns how many tokens were consumed, not how many returned.",blockchainsmartcontractsnearprotocolnear,,secretshardul,"Add a comment

It was missing all the terms and conditions Governing FILS ownership, holding and circulation:
1. FILS founders shall undertake and guarantee not to sell or swap any of their FILS crypto tokens before the elapse of two years post FILS crypto token creation. When the two years are elapsed and a founder desires to sell, send, swap or in any way dispose of his FILS crypto token, no more than 2% of FILS crypto tokens in the founder’s wallet can be sold every 45 days.
2. FILS co-founders shall undertake and guarantee not to sell, send, swap or in any way dispose of their FILS crypto tokens before the elapse of one year post FILS crypto token creation. When the one year is elapsed and a co-founder desires to sell his/her FILS crypto tokens, no more than 2.5% of FILS crypto tokens in co-founder’s wallet can be sold every 30 days. 3. No FILS holder shall be allowed to hold more than two million (2,000,000) FILS crypto tokens in circulation. This clause shall serve as an anti-whale constraint to prevent any whale maneuvers and to secure a stable FILS crypto token position as much as possible. This clause may be revisited on a yearly basis. 4. FILS shall prudently and rigorously ensure and supervise strict application of relevant rules and regulations to prevent any kind of monetary manipulation, fraud, terrorism funding or money laundering activities. 5. FILS shall maintain a market balancing policy that mitigates market fluctuations and anomalies, if needed. One factor of this policy is to destroy a considerable number of FILS crypto tokens when required and in a timely manner, provided that the total of which may not exceed 1% of FILS crypto tokens in circulation every year. 6. FILS shall accordingly ensure prompt and efficient response to market sudden movements and fluctuations to best serve and safeguard FILS holders’ interests and investments. Such practices may include repurchases of FILS crypto tokens to uplift FILS prices, when necessary. 7. On March 25, 2024, and after the passage of two years of FILS launch, LANDOUSES shall start accepting FILS crypto token as a payment method for LANDOUSES properties and operations (sell and buy). This shall include all LANDOUSES purchases operations for all its required items such as construction materials, etc

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

I'm trying to test out liquidity for my own token on the Binance Smart Chain, however I'm encountering a confusing issue that I can't seem to figure out.
I created a token with a supply of 1,000,000 (lets call it TOKEN). I am holding all of them in my Metamask wallet and I go to pancakeswap to provide liquidity. As a test, I added 100 TOKEN in a liquidity pool with 0.0001 BNB, setting the price at 1 TOKEN = 0.000001 BNB. Up until this point, everything is working fine.
Then I went to buy 100 TOKEN using 0.0001 BNB, and it says that the price impact is about 99.8%, which is okay with me, and I understand that since I'm buying the entire supply of liquidity.
At this point, after the transaction, I should have 1,000,000 TOKEN in my wallet again, so theoretically, at least in my mind, I can sell my 1,000,000 TOKEN for the old price of 0.0000001 BNB x 1.998 (0.000001998 BNB = 1 TOKEN), after factoring the calculated price impact. According to my calculations, this would mean that by selling 1,000,000 TOKEN, I would receive 1,000,000*0.000001998 = 1.998 BNB after the trade.
However, when I try to execute the trade, the price Pancakeswap sets for my sale of 1,000,000 TOKEN is less than what I originally set as liquidity, meaning that I end up with less BNB than what I started with.
I'm relatively new to the concept of liquidity and setting up your own crypto token, so I would really really appreciate if anyone with more knowledge can help explain what exactly is going on here?
I don’t have any pictures right now but I’ll try to add some when I’m home later.

Filter display for items in a blockchain (Javascript + node,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71760349/filter-display-for-items-in-a-blockchain-javascript-node,0,1,26,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJy-jb1H6bvfqAl642l8mA6F5oNWNt-wW-bOQZNW=k-s32,"Apr 6, 2022 at 2:18",11,Beige Waves,https://stackoverflow.com/users/18719450/beige-waves,Filter display for items in a blockchain (Javascript + node,10 months ago,10 months ago,"I'm currently learning to create a blockchain in Javascript (with node.js) following SimplyExplained on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124), and I would like to only display the blocks belong to the holder that the user asked for. I tried using the filter function for arrays but there's an error saying it's not a function.
It's basically the same as the one in the video mentioned but added ""Issuer"" and ""Verifier"":
const SHA256 = require(""crypto-js/sha256"")

var readline = require('readline-sync');
var a = 0;
var issuer = readline.question(""Input your name as an issuer: "");
var holder = ""default"";

class Block{
    constructor(issuer, holder, timestamp, credential, previousHash = """"){
      this.issuer = issuer;
      this.holder = holder;
      this.timestamp = timestamp;
      this.credential = credential;
      this.previousHash = previousHash;
      this.hash = this.calculateHash();
    }
  
    calculateHash(){
      return SHA256(this.issuer + this.holder + this.timestamp + JSON.stringify(this.credential) + this.previousHash).toString();
    }

}

let mainchain = new Blockchain();

And then this part requires some simple user input, like asking if you're adding or viewing the credentials. There are only three ""holders"" for now to facilitate the debugging. (I allowed the display of the entire blockchain after adding so I can see what's wrong, usually I hide it)
while (a < 1){
    var userActionChoice = readline.question(""Would you like to add or view? "");

if (userActionChoice.toLowerCase() == ""add"") {
    var holderID = readline.question(""Input holder ID: "");
    var credential = readline.question(""Input qualification/credential: ""); 
    var timestamp = readline.question(""Input date of qualification above: "");
    if (holderID.toLowerCase() == ""s123456""){
        holder = ""Beige Waves"";
    }
    else if (holderID.toLowerCase() == ""s987654""){
        holder = ""Mickey Mouse"";
    }
    else if (holderID.toLowerCase() == ""s888888""){
        holder = ""Donald Duck"";
    } 
    mainchain.addBlock(new Block(issuer, holder, timestamp, credential));
        console.log(JSON.stringify(mainchain, null, 4));
        console.log(""Added successfully to the Blockchain! It is "" + mainchain.isChainValid() + "" that the chain is valid."");
}
else {
    var holderID = readline.question(""What is the ID of the holder whose qualifications you would like to check? "");
    if (holderID.toLowerCase() == ""s123456""){
        holder = ""Beige Waves"";
    }
    else if (holderID.toLowerCase() == ""s987654""){
        holder = ""Mickey Mouse"";
    }
    else if (holderID.toLowerCase() == ""s888888""){
        holder = ""Donald Duck"";
    } 
    
var selected = mainchain.filter(function(selectedHolder){
    return selectedHolder.holder == holder;
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(selected))
}

    var userActionChoice = readline.question(""Would you like to exit the program? (Y/N) "")

    if (userActionChoice.toLowerCase() == ""y"") {
        console.log(""Goodbye."");
        a += 1;
    }
}

When I test it with node.js, the blockchain display was fine after adding something, but when I want to only show one holder's credentials, the error appeared:
macbookair% node /Users/(path)/blockchain.js 

Input your name as an issuer: disney
Would you like to add or view? add

var selected = mainchain.filter(function(selectedHolder){
                         ^

TypeError: mainchain.filter is not a function

The result I think I want to see should be something like this, only with the blocks with credentials belonging to Beige Waves:
 {
            ""issuer"": ""disney"",
            ""holder"": ""Beige Waves"",
            ""timestamp"": ""today"",
            ""credential"": ""driver's license"",
            ""previousHash"": ""6a2460df4316862c2bf2a5652e98b51a5adb1e46d6f175bf97ad5f638121bba6"",
            ""hash"": ""b1fcbba67ccc78e3099d45b1996769a407b643d9bdc71f9c4bbc40b07f8ee12f""
        }

Is it not working because the Blockchain is not an array (it has the curly brackets at the beginning instead of the square brackets)? Is there any solution to this problem? Thank you very much.
(PS. This is my first time using Stack Overflow and I'm not very sure what code snippets to show so I put all my codes in here except the ones with double slashes. I'd very much appreciate the feedback, and thank you once again.)",javascriptnode.jsblockchain,"Apr 6, 2022 at 8:51",,"Add a comment

Polygon Edge local node: cant ADD transaction to TX POOL,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71622226/polygon-edge-local-node-cant-add-transaction-to-tx-pool,0,1,370,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bdc65dc2370eebeba1f1aa52a1db688a?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Mar 25, 2022 at 19:33",377,Eduardo G.R.,https://stackoverflow.com/users/5286467/eduardo-g-r,Polygon Edge local node: cant ADD transaction to TX POOL,10 months ago,8 months ago,"I already have a local Polygon-Edge blockchain running on my system. It is working as expected with four nodes running (I can query address balances, for example, and it works just fine).
Now I'm following the Polygon Edge documentation to ADD a new transaction into the TX POOL, this is what the documentation:
https://edge-docs.polygon.technology/docs/working-with-node/query-json-rpc

Step 4: Send a transfer transaction Now that we've confirmed the
account we set up as premined has the correct balance, we can transfer
some ether:
polygon-edge txpool add --nonce 0 --from
0x1010101010101010101010101010101010101010 --to
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000010 --value 0x100 The txpool
add command adds the transaction to the transaction pool.
In this case, the transfer is from
0x1010101010101010101010101010101010101010 to
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000010, with the value being 0x100
wei.

When I run that command I get this output:
$ polygon-edge txpool add --nonce 0 --from 0x1010101010101010101010101010101010101010 --to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000010 --value 0x100 --grpc-address localhost:10000
Error: unknown flag: --nonce
Usage:
   txpool [command]

Available Commands:
  status      Returns the number of transactions in the transaction pool
  subscribe   Logs specific TxPool events

Flags:
      --grpc-address string   the GRPC interface (default ""127.0.0.1:9632"")
  -h, --help                  help for txpool

Global Flags:
      --json   get all outputs in json format (default false)

Use "" txpool [command] --help"" for more information about a command.

unknown flag: --nonce

As you can see in the output there is no ""ADD"" command. The documentation seems to be wrong...

// Stores a new value in the contract
  function store(uint256 newValue) public onlyOwner {
    value = newValue;
    emit ValueChanged(newValue);
  }

First I made the, function selector like this...
const governor = await ethers.getContract(""GovernorContract"");
const box = await ethers.getContract(""Box"");

const encodedFunctionCall = box.interface.encodeFunctionData('store', [77]);

and on consoling, I'm getting this selector in bytes...

Now, I'm calling the propose function...
const proposeTx = await governor.propose(
        [box.address],
        [0],
        [encodedFunctionCall],
        proposalDescription
    );

But here, I'm getting the error...

After modifying everything in the frontend, i now just need to Deploy the Smart Contracts, which is an autonomous Ecosystem of Contracts that run themselves with minimal setup after deployment. However, they are only setup and in turn run themselves after you make several function calls to some of the contracts (setting a variable to point to an address, setting a variable to a startTime, etc).
I cannot figure out exactly what these Deployers of the same ecosystem of contracts are doing (what function calls they're making with what variables after deployment).
I have used the appropriate BlockChain's blockscan site (AVAX, snowtrace.io), in order to figure out what order they deploy the contracts in - and i can see SOME of the function calls they make but the variables are not always able to have the ""date decoded"", and the ""Method"" is not always listed either, etc. Is their something I don't understand or that I am doing wrong in order to figure this out? I am new to all of this. The Open Source Project has no README or GUIDE explaining a damn thing about a damn thing, I've so far had to figure out everything front and backend 100% by myself, and now that it's down to the wire with the whole Dapp being finished, with only function calls left in my way.",blockchainsoliditydecodesmartcontractsfunction-call,,EasterEggs,"Add a comment

Create Solidity contract instance as a result of long running process,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71417303/create-solidity-contract-instance-as-a-result-of-long-running-process,0,1,80,https://graph.facebook.com/10153691392072438/picture?type=large,"Mar 9, 2022 at 23:48",41,TJ Hoeft,https://stackoverflow.com/users/5493653/tj-hoeft,Create Solidity contract instance as a result of long running process,11 months ago,8 months ago,"How can I write to the blockchain after an undetermined, time-consuming execution result?
Situation:

Web Client (NextJS): User requests a long running process that can take up to 1 hour to complete. As a result of this transaction, a new contract instance should be written to the blockchain. We can't expect the client to stick around waiting => use a NodeJS or cloud function to delegate the long running task. Metamask on the client will define the contract owner.
Planning to use NextJS to route to a Moralis Cloud Fx to kick off the long running task. The result of this long running task will be digital content to store to the blockchain.

Constraints/Problem:

Can’t have the user wait for the process to complete
Metamask runs on the client
Need Moralis Cloud Fx or NodeJS to have access to the owner to instantiate the contract at an undetermined future point in time.

The owners have to validate the transaction with their wallets (phantom, solflare etc..) 
And everything works great, for most NFTs.


Some NFT owners are complaining about not being able to validate the transaction on the wallet, an error message indicates that the transaction can't be confirmed.
However, the NFT can be transferred successfully using the wallet's interface, can be listed on marketplaces etc. Even when the NFT is transferred to another wallet, the transaction above works perfectly.

At first glance it seems impossible but I doubt it.
As a basic example I'm trying to get a ""incrementor"" working only if a ""flipper"" is on:
contract Flipper {
  bool private value;

  constructor (bool initValue) {
    value = initValue;
  }

  function flip () public {
    value = !value;
  }

  function get () public view returns (bool) {
    return value;
  }

}

I want to use a Flipper instance in my Incrementor contract to allow / disallow incrementing.
import ""flipper.sol"";

contract Incrementor {

    uint256 _count;
    Flipper _flipper;

    constructor (uint256 _initialValue, Flipper _flipperContract) {
        _count = _initialValue;
        _flipper = _flipperContract;
    }

    // --
    // Mutators
    // --

    function increment () public {
      require(_flipper.get(), ""Flipper must be ON"");
      _count += 1;
    }

    function superFlip () public {
      _flipper.flip();
    }

    function setValue (uint256 v) public {
        _count = v;
    }

    // --
    // Accessors
    // --

    function count () public view returns (uint256) {
        return _count;
    }

}

When testing all of this on polkadotjs; I have a negative answer saying contract trapped ALONG with a success message (but the totality doesn't work).
(Failure on the ""increment"" message):


I'm not sure but I suspect this problem to arise from the difference in addressing in the EVM vs WASM.
In the article linked bellow, we can see how an external contract function is ""manually"" invoked with an ""address.call(bytes4(keccack25('...')), args)"".
https://medium.com/@blockchain101/calling-the-function-of-another-contract-in-solidity-f9edfa921f4c
Except this is working in a EVM environment; not a WASM substrate environment.

Can somebody please tell me, What formula do I need to use for estimating the fee for the above coins?

I tried changing the way the way i return the instance by using
 const collection = ethers.getContractAt(NFT.abi, address, provider);

But that just throws another error

And when i tried importing hardhat so that I could change the above code to
const hre = require(""hardhat"");

const collection = hre.ethers.getContractAt(NFT.abi, address, provider);

My application doesnt compile and throws this error:

When I try to swap from PancakeSwap on BNB testnet (https://pancake.kiemtienonline360.com) calling the function swapExactTokensForTokens from a interface it returns me ""Gas estimation failed: 'execution reverted'. This transaction will likely revert."" but I know probably it's nothing related to gas
Here is my approve function:
def approve_pancake(pancakeRouterv2, amount):
    account = get_account()
    wbnb = ""0xae13d989dac2f0debff460ac112a837c89baa7cd""  # WBNB address

    erc20 = interface.IPancakeRouter01(
        wbnb)  # Access to Interfaces with WBNB address
    tx = erc20.approve(pancakeRouterv2, amount, {""from"": account})  # Aprove
    tx.wait(1)

print(""Approved CK"")

Then I try my swapExactTokensForTokens:
def swap_pancake():
    account = get_account()
    simple_storage = BabyDoge.deploy(
        ""0x2514895c72f50D8bd4B4F9b1110F0D6bD2c97526"", {""from"": account})  # Deploying contract - First address is for AgreggatorV3PriceFeed
    amount = Web3.toWei(0.1, ""ether"")
    # Path to smartcontract calling that function
    path = simple_storage.getPathForWBNBtoDAI()
    pancakeRouter = interface.IPancakeRouter01(  # IPancakeRouter01 Interface with pancake router address
        config[""networks""][network.show_active()][""pancake_address""])
    # Pancake router address RAW
    pancakeRouterv2 = ""0x9Ac64Cc6e4415144C455BD8E4837Fea55603e5c3""
    wbnbAddress = interface.IPancakeRouter01(
        config[""networks""][network.show_active()][""wbnb_token""])  # IPancakeRouter01 address with WBNB Token

    # Approving Pancake Router Address with amount
    approve_pancake(pancakeRouterv2, amount)
    transFrom = wbnbAddress.transferFrom(
        account, pancakeRouterv2, amountIn, {""from"": account, ""gas"": 805000, ""allow_revert"": True})  # Testing transFrom in case was needed
    swap_tx = pancakeRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(
        amountIn, amountOutMin, path, account, deadline, {""from"": account})

    print(f""Line txt{swap_tx}"")

And it gives me this error:

I also tried without a transform and did not work
Here is my path of addresses
address constant BUSD = 0xDAcbdeCc2992a63390d108e8507B98c7E2B5584a;
address constant WBNB = 0xae13d989daC2f0dEbFf460aC112a837C89BAa7cd;

function getPathForWBNBtoDAI() public view returns (address[] memory) {
    address[] memory path = new address[](2);
    path[0] = WBNB;
    path[1] = BUSD;

    return path;
}

I also have BNB, WBNB in my account, I tried to swap manually and it worked
Could someone tell me what I'm missing? Also if you could insert a real example usage would be good

I copy paste the addresses to make sure they are correct, but this throws an error everytime. And I think it doesn't work because we'd need an address type as first argument right? I can't find out how to achieve that, anyone can help and point me in the right direction here?

                I think you don't need to worry about type conversion since solidity manages a string as an address when you pass it through parameters. It seems that tmpdata is returning a Null or maybe an undefined value. Could you please try the same code adding an await before 'ethers.utils.getAddress(...);' ?

Take this random address as an example: https://etherscan.io/address/0xcb0fee000ede5fa999c242f8a553c3bc72e10882#tokentxns
If I retrieve the 49 token transfer events from the etherscan api that this address has been evolved in and build up the portfolio, I get this:
{
  ""eth 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"": 731679809973000,

}

If I check here manually: https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xcb0fee000ede5fa999c242f8a553c3bc72e10882 I instead get this (every balance * 1e18 to get the same units as in the api):
{
  ""eth 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"": 731679809973000,
  ""SAITAMA 0x8b3192f5eebd8579568a2ed41e6feb402f93f73f"": 1070751279259610000000000,
  ""ABSHIBA.com 0x5ccce837b41dbd2ad74882889749517935741390"": 8239291000000000000000000,

}

So as you can see, some of them are correct and some are not. If we take ""ABSHIBA.com"" as an example, etherscan shows that this address holds 8239291000000000000000000 of it (here: https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xcb0fee000ede5fa999c242f8a553c3bc72e10882). However if I build up the portfolio myself, I get that this address only holds 352134000000000 of it. If I check the transfers manually, I see that there is only one ""token transfer event"" for this address where ""ABSHIBA.com"" is involved, and is it that someone sent this address 352134000000000 of it. So how is etherscan showing the balance as 8239291000000000000000000? (85410.09 if you change units). Am I missing something? Or is etherscan showing the wrong balance?",blockchainethereumcryptocurrencyetherscan,,lapurita,"Add a comment

Create a React frontend that looks like the map image and connect the NFTs from the .sol - but how would this work?
Build the UI from the smart contract itself.

How to read recent transactions from Uniswap V3 using Python?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70187616/how-to-read-recent-transactions-from-uniswap-v3-using-python,0,1,815,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e7720ef5cf05214b18f508ef8b5f20f?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG,"Dec 1, 2021 at 16:14",37,DefiBax,https://stackoverflow.com/users/17563642/defibax,How to read recent transactions from Uniswap V3 using Python?,"1 year, 2 months ago","1 year, 2 months ago","I am trying to get details on the most recent transactions from the ETH/USDT .3% Uniswap V3 pool.
Using get_price_input() from Uniswap-Python API I am able to read the most recent price for a given pool but the API does not have a function to read Total Value, Token Amount nor whether ETH is being swapped for USDT or USDT for ETH. This link has a good representation of what I'm looking for: https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x4e68ccd3e89f51c3074ca5072bbac773960dfa36
I am aware that many use The Graph to get hourly or daily data, but that is not fast enough, as I'm looking for the most recent transaction.
Beyond Uniswap-Python API I'm not sure where to start for using python to read recent data directly from the blockchain. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
Edit:
I've been reading through the Web3.py and Uniswap documentation.
Here is a way to do it on Uniswap V1 that doesn't work as getEthToTokenInputPrice doesn't work for V3.

I came across this article explaining that to determine the original input from a 128-bit hash value, using brute force, the worst case scenario would be 2^128 – 1 attempts (meaning there are 2^128 possible answers - from what I understand).
But... Isn't 128 bits the length of the hash - not the length of the original input? Wouldn't you have to try all possible cases of input data? And wouldn't that be a totally different number of possibilities unless the input data were also exactly 128 1s or 0s?",hashblockchainbrute-forcecryptocurrency,"Oct 31, 2021 at 0:41",,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                You are correct. The article is a little sloppy in that spot. The mathematics is tad bit more complicated, and in truth there is no guarantee that you can ever recover the actual input A from H(A) because there may be two (or more!) values A1 and A2 such that H(A1) = H(A2). However, for most applications of hash functions, any input that hashes to the same value is good enough to break the system. And for blockchain applications, the input may very well be 128 bits (or 256 bits for SHA256).

Where does the reputation contract, order matching contract and aggregation contract come into the picture? Where and with whom do they interact? From what I could test in API calls and price feeds, I can only choose nodes and jobs, but not reputation.
Also, do the nodes actually bid to receive requests? I didn't find anything about node bid in the documentation. Only payments for running jobs.

                @PatrickCollins Yeah, I have, but in the whitepaper it talks about reputation contract, order matching contract and aggregation contract which isn't referenced on the Chainlink Architecture Overview.  I mean, the whitepaper talks about an order-matching smart contract taking bids from oracle providers and there isn't any info about this on the Chainlink docs. Is it that the real architecture is totally different from the one on the whitepaper?

Smart Contracts Revert,"1 year, 3 months ago","1 year, 3 months ago","I'm tweaking with ink! Smart contracts and deployed some test contracts through https://polkadot.js.org/. However, despite setting conditional statements within smart contracts, calls to them still pass without reverting. Am I doing something wrong with the error handling?
Example code:
  #[ink(message)]
    pub fn withdraw_(&mut self, value: Balance) -> Result<()>  {
        let caller= self.env().caller();
        let contract_address = self.env().account_id();

        self.tickets.insert(caller, ticket_count - 1);

      let transfer_status =  self.transfer_from_to_reentrant(contract_address,caller,value);

      if !transfer_status {
          return Err(Error::UnsucceededTransfer)
      }

        

        Ok(())

                @tifrel Yes, it did not change. However, it would've been so much better if it reverted with the ""Error"" specified in the code. Easier to test. Seems like they are working on it. You can check issues on the main repo.

                I totally agree with you. IIRC the contracts return something. If you parse it, you may just see an Err(Error::YaddaYadda), or something like {error: 4}, where 4 is the position of the variant of you Error enum in rust/ink. Should you need proper error-handling before it's implemented by Parity, that might do the job for you :)

I can assign successfully, but the question is can I make sure that the _mint and _setTokenURI is done before inserting array to Map. can someone give me the example on handling this case.
The idea that come in my mind is like IF logic, when _mint and _setTokenURI is not done, then pending assigning value to Map until its done.

                In that case I would suggest you use the latest version of hyperledger fabric. If you want a good starting development environment you can use the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension as this will provide a nice dev environment for hyperledger fabric

                We can't possibly know how that API should be used. We didn't develop it. If it's some application you installed, then refer to it's manual. If it's still unclear, you should contact the developers. Check if they have some support or forum. Also, the answer you got this from was over three years old. Are you sure it's the same version or that works the same way as it did then?

I do not posses knowledge on BC besides the basic but I do have access to all the configuration of this environment and I want to learn from this.
The problem I'm facing is that, when a new signer pod is created, the genesis initContainer fails with the following error:

INFO [10-01|13:48:58.132] Maximum peer count ETH=25 LES=0 total=25
INFO [10-01|13:48:58.132] Allocated cache and file handles
database=/ethereum/geth/chaindata cache=16 handles=16
Fatal: Failed to open database: resource temporarily unavailable
Fatal: Failed to open database: resource temporarily unavailable

The signer deployment is configured so it has a shared volume between the pods:
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: config
      configMap:
        name: genesis-config-6hbt7fcf72
        items:
          - key: genesis.json
            path: genesis.json
        defaultMode: 420
    - name: chaindata
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: volume-signer1
  initContainers:
    - name: genesis
      image: 'ethereum/client-go:alltools-v1.8.27'
      command:
        - geth
      args:
        - '--datadir=/ethereum'
        - init
        - /tmp/json/genesis.json
      resources: {}
      volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          readOnly: true
          mountPath: /tmp/json/genesis.json
          subPath: genesis.json
        - name: chaindata
          mountPath: /ethereum
      terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      terminationMessagePolicy: File
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

I think this error may be caused exactly by this shared volume, as it's trying to init a new BC database that already exists but I'm not sure of this as this is my first time working with this (I didn't configure this, I'm just trying to fix it).
As this is a production environment I can't test this so easily but I do have non-production environments where I can test stuff.

initial token creation (0x00 -> myWallet)
function addLiquidityETH(myWallet, myToken, WBNB -> myPool)

But at the same time (exact same timestamp) there were more transactions:

myToken transaction (function Safe Buy) from myPool to a ""public"" PancakeSwap wallet that records a lot of transactions.

So far so good without any problem and the data is accesable on ipfs network. The question of mine is very conceptual and fundamental I believe.
Apparently, the image uploaded to ipfs is stored in the ipfs nodes. And the image will be accessible as long as there is at least one node holding the image data. or we will need to pin it. Otherwise, the data will be no longer seen.
And I found the article from the following link saying that the add() execution with default pin with infura API. I am not sure if it is correct because I event does not provide any infura API secret key for this operation. Or is it a free service?

I'm trying to understand the scope of the require statement across multiple contracts. I want to design a master contract that a user can set an allowance for that then interacts with several other subcontracts that costs a custom ERC20 token to interact with. The idea is that the user only needs to authorize the master contract that manages their tokens and makes sure that they are transferred to the other contracts for payment when interacted with it, rather than have to get the user to set an allowance for all the other contracts individually.
Say for example we have two contracts, contract A is the master (in this scenario the user has already set the correct allowance), and contract B, the contract that the user wants to interact with. The user calls the function in contract A which checks that they have the required amount of tokens to use the function in b before execution. if everything checks out on the finance side, contract A calls the function in contract B which also needs to check certain variables to proceed.  Providing everything checks out, B adds the user to a mapping and returns, then A executes the transferfrom function.  (I hope this all makes sense);
Could the user change the allowance to zero at some point during call_b's execution in a way that passed the first two require statements but fails when transferfrom executes and if that did happen would a require fail in A revert the storage changes made in B as a result?
or
the other option I have considered is transferring the user's tokes immediately after passing the financial checks and relying on the require statement around  B.f(msg.sender)  to revert the transfer if it fails. (if continue get set to false)
or
is this all really dumb and there is much a better way to proceed.
Thanks in advance for all your help.

  const contract = await new web3.eth.Contract(

  contract.events
    .Transfer({

      filter: { from: contracts[1] }
    })

I think that is because my docker images are not running at the moment and I can't start them manually because they immediately stop running.
So I started network with ./network.sh up, and when the network is up I tried to make channel with CA with ./network.sh up createChannel -c mychannel -ca, but I get next error.

Instead of using cryptogen i have used fabric-ca to generate the identities. I'm able to start the peers and orderers and able to create channel and join both the peers into the channel.
After joining the peers to channel, I could see the orderer logs:

#   SECTION: Capabilities
#
#   - This section defines the capabilities of fabric network. This is a new
#   concept as of v1.1.0 and should not be utilized in mixed networks with
#   v1.0.x peers and orderers.  Capabilities define features which must be
#   present in a fabric binary for that binary to safely participate in the
#   fabric network.  For instance, if a new MSP type is added, newer binaries
#   might recognize and validate the signatures from this type, while older
#   binaries without this support would be unable to validate those
#   transactions.  This could lead to different versions of the fabric binaries
#   having different world states.  Instead, defining a capability for a channel
#   informs those binaries without this capability that they must cease
#   processing transactions until they have been upgraded.  For v1.0.x if any
#   capabilities are defined (including a map with all capabilities turned off)
#   then the v1.0.x peer will deliberately crash.

You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type,"1 year, 7 months ago","1 year, 7 months ago","I'm a novice at React, so I apologize in advance if this is a very stupid and obvious mistake.
I'm trying to create a Decentralized Application (DApp) for a simple file transfer-over-blockchain.
I'm following the tutorial at : https://itnext.io/build-a-simple-ethereum-interplanetary-file-system-ipfs-react-js-dapp-23ff4914ce4e (tl;dr version - basically a file transfer over the blockchain network. You upload file to IPFS and then send the IPFS location from one blockchain account to another). For the front-end, I am using React.
Two things to note -
1. I am using Ropsten network instead of Rinkeby which has been used in this article
2. In REMIX, I have set the environment for deploying as 'Injected Web3'. (something the original project was ambiguous about)
One of the dependencies for this project is ipfs-api, but that is now deprecated. So I had to use ipfs-http-client instead. Successfully npm installed it. Upon compiling, however, I get the error
./node_modules/ipfs-http-client/src/lib/to-url-search-params.js
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (10:61)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
|  * @returns {URLSearchParams}

| module.exports = ({ arg, searchParams, hashAlg, mtime, mode, ...options } = {}) => {
|   if (searchParams) {

The to-url-search-params.js file -
'use strict'

const modeToString = require('./mode-to-string')
const { parseMtime } = require('ipfs-unixfs')

/**
 * @param {*} params
 * @returns {URLSearchParams}
 */
module.exports = ({ arg, searchParams, hashAlg, mtime, mode, ...options } = {}) => {
  if (searchParams) {
    options = {
      ...options,
      ...searchParams
    }
  }

  if (hashAlg) {
    options.hash = hashAlg
  }

  if (mtime != null) {
    mtime = parseMtime(mtime)

    options.mtime = mtime.secs
    options.mtimeNsecs = mtime.nsecs
  }

  if (mode != null) {
    options.mode = modeToString(mode)
  }

  if (options.timeout && !isNaN(options.timeout)) {
    // server API expects timeouts as strings
    options.timeout = `${options.timeout}ms`
  }

  if (arg === undefined || arg === null) {
    arg = []
  } else if (!Array.isArray(arg)) {
    arg = [arg]
  }

  arg.forEach((/** @type {any} */ arg) => urlSearchParams.append('arg', arg))

  return urlSearchParams

As a return object, you'll receive a TXSkeleton containing a
slightly-more complete TX alongside data you need to sign in the
tosign array. You'll need this object for the next steps of the
transaction creation process.


Locally Sign Your Transaction
With your TXSkeleton returned from the New Transaction Endpoint, you
now need to use your private key(s) to sign the data provided in the
tosign array.


$PRIVATEKEY here is a hex-encoded private key corresponding to the input from address CEztKBAYNoUEEaPYbkyFeXC5v8Jz9RoZH9

My problem is how do we obtain the private key of each address in HD Wallet? With HD Wallet addresses are generated using the Derive Address Endpoint. This returns a HDWallet object which contains and HDChain object which contains an HDAddress Object. The HDAddress object contains address, path and public.

An HD Address object contains an address and its BIP32 HD path
(location of the address in the HD tree). It also contains the
hex-encoded public key when returned from the Derive Address in Wallet
endpoint.

As you can see, the private key is not included in HDAddress object response. So how can we know the private key to use with tosign method if the private key is not included in HDAddress object response? And without access to private key, how can we sign the **tosign** array?

The method I'm trying to follow is this -

The client sends the server the (claimed) WAX wallet address
The server creates a random hash and sends it to the client
The client creates a transaction with the hash and signs it. Instead of pushing it to the chain, the transaction is created with broadcast set to false and it sends the signed transaction to the server
This is the part where I'm having a problem. What I want to do is use the eosjs API to get the actual public key of the wallet address, and then use eosjs-ecc's recover or verify methods to get a public key from the transaction and verify that it is the same. When I try this, it is producing different public keys each time and none of them match the actual one.

Here's the code I have at the moment: https://github.com/udbhav-s/waxlogindemo
If the method I'm trying isn't possible, is there any other way to authenticate a user without using on chain transactions?",authenticationblockchaincryptocurrencyeos,,udbhavs,"I don't know how, but a number of sites use the WAX cloud wallet to authenticate and they are not generating any transactions.

You can directly ask user to sign any random string and then recover the signature and the recover address will be its public key. let me know if I am missing something. @udbhavs

                It looks like a lot of the work is done through api's and monitoring contracts from the blockchain producers. A lot of the sites that keep track of crypto spaces are primarily using pre-made/custom apis. A project to recreate the vasteness of bloks would be no easy feature.

If you access the Metamask connection without it(the BSC MainNet), you get ""No connected web3 wallet detected!""

                My guess is that sudo truffle runs the globally installed truffle and looks for the fs-extra in the global dependencies (where it doesn't exist)... Have you tried installing and running the whole thing without the -g option and without sudo? ... A workaround might be npm install -g fs-extra but this is not a clean approach.

It seems like I have a wrong gnache or truffle setup ...
I already ask a simular question here: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/96681/owner-of-contract-is-set-to-contract-address
Basicly there is some mess up with addresses on my local chain (it works on testnet).
The setup/migration is the same like in the link.
The actual functions:
    function claim(uint256 pid, uint256 cAmount, address test) external nonReentrant returns (bool){
        return _claim(pid, cAmount, test);
    }

    function _claim(uint256 pid, uint256 cAmount, address test) internal returns (bool){
        require(test == msg.sender, ""ERROR"");
        bool success;
        uint256 possibleClaim = _getClaimableAmount(pid, test);
        require(possibleClaim >= cAmount, ""Claim: Not enough claimable amount"");
        _reflow(pid);
        uint256 tempDaoFee = cAmount.mul(_poolInfo[pid].claimFee);
        uint256 daoFee = tempDaoFee.div(100);
        success = IERC20(_poolInfo[pid].poolT.rewardToken).transfer(test, cAmount.sub(daoFee));
        _poolInfo[pid].poolT.rewardToken.transfer(_poolInfo[pid].daoWallet, daoFee);
        return success;
    }


the test:
it(""7.1 Claim: ..."", async ()=> {
        const adr = await irs.getRewardToken(""0"");

        console.log(""Address: "",adr)
        console.log(""TokenAddress: "", iwbtc.address)
        console.log(""ContractAddress: "", irs.address)

        const balanceOFContract0 = await iwbtc.balanceOf(irs.address);
        const bal0 = await iwbtc.balanceOf(accounts[6])

        console.log(""balanceOFContract = "", balanceOFContract0.toString())
        console.log(""balanceBeforClaim = "", bal0.toString())

        const claimable = await irs.getClaimableAmount(""0"",accounts[6]);
        const val = claimable / 2;

        console.log(""Val = "", val.toString())

        const success = await irs.claim(""0"",val,accounts[6], {from: accounts[6]});

        const bal1 = await iwbtc.balanceOf(accounts[6])
        const balanceOFContract1 = await iwbtc.balanceOf(irs.address);

        console.log(""balanceOFContract = "", balanceOFContract1.toString())
        console.log(""balanceBeforClaim = "", bal1.toString())
        console.log(""Transaction:"", success)

    });

So ...

The transaction happen but the sender dont recieve the funds but the contract sended it.
The msg.sender is the givin parameter... (require in the _claim) dont get the fund and is not in the transaction

Tryed around with IERC20() and without ... no difference (would make me wonder anyway).
Anyone any idea what is happening here?",blockchainsoliditysmartcontractstruffleganache,"Apr 12, 2021 at 8:25",,"Hmm... normaly there should be a ""Hi"" at the begining but its just cutted of :/

                It seems like the contract with address _poolInfo[pid].poolT.rewardToken fails the transfer() function, which results in returning false from the _claim()  function (in your contract). However, your JS snippet returns the transaction object, not the Solidity return value, so it's not possible to verify using the data that you've shared... I'd recommend debugging the ERC contract's transfer() function on your local chain, whether and why it returns false. (Possibly the sender doesn't have enough tokens?)

As the seller adds the product for sale it shows up in the buy component for buyers to purchase, but as one more product is added for sale, the buy component only shows the latest added product for sale and not all the products.
I'm using map function to map through the array of products, below is the code which returns the buyer side component:
<tbody id=""productList"">
   { productList.map((product, key) => {
      return(
        <tr key={key}>
        <th scope=""row"">{ product.id.toString()}</th>
        <td>{product.name}</td>
        <td>{window.web3.utils.fromWei(product.price.toString(), 'Ether')} ETH</td>
        <td>{product.owner}</td>
        <td>
          { !product.purchased
            ? <button className=""btn btn-primary""
                  name={product.id}
                  value={product.price}
                  onClick{purchaseProduct(e.target.name, e.target.value)                                                            }}                                                       >Buy
              </button>
            : <button className=""btn btn-success"">Owned</button>
          }
         </td>
         </tr>
       );
     })}
</tbody>

productList is the state containing the product list being passed down from the App.js and the loadBlockchainData function where we connect to the smart contract and define productList:
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);  
const [account, setAccount] = useState("""");
const [marketplace, setMarketplace] = useState("""");
const [productList, setProducts] = useState([]);


const loadBlockchainData = async () => {
    const web3 = window.web3;

    const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();

    setAccount(accounts[0]);
    const networkId = await web3.eth.net.getId();
    const networkData = Marketplace.networks[networkId]
    if (networkData) {
      const marketplace = new web3.eth.Contract(Marketplace.abi, networkData.address);
      // console.log(marketplace);
      setMarketplace(marketplace);
      const productCount = await marketplace.methods.productCount().call();
      // console.log(productCount.toString());
      setProductCount(productCount);
      for (var i = 1; i <= productCount; i++) {
        const product = await marketplace.methods.products(i).call();
        setProducts([...productList, product]);
        console.log(productList);

      }
      setLoading(false);
    } else {
      window.alert(""Marketplace contract not deployed to detected network."");
      // setloading2(true);
    }
  };

Also, after clicking on the buy button the page needs to be refreshed manually to change the Buy button to Owned, the state does not update automatically, how can that be implemented.",reactjsblockchainsmartcontractsweb3jsmetamask,"Dec 6, 2022 at 16:35",TylerH,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                you need to share your parent and child component code for this case. Also i would suggest not to use setProducts inside loop. Instead make a variable list and simply do all operations on list variable inside loop and then finally use setProducts(list) outside loop.

Let me know if anything else might help resolve these issues.
Here is the link to the video however the advertised ""FREE"" learning actually requires $30 for the source code once you realize what you have received does not work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5E_yBMt7Io&t=1s
Since I'm not an idiot I did not send someone money simply because they shared a few chopped up videos and asked for it in an email, but the lengthy 7-part series to deceive people into obligatorily purchasing after the ""FREE"" learning is illegal misrepresentation as well as unethically conning people interested in the fledgling blockchain technologies.
Any help is greatly appreciated!",javaandroidblockchain,"Mar 9, 2021 at 4:51",,"Add a comment

The reason it fails as far as I can see is that the compressed public key I am passing to the function bitcoin.pubkey_to_address() is one digit too short. As it is one of the most famous bitcoin libraries I assume that there is a fundamental error in my understanding. Thus, the question: what am I doing wrong in computing the compressed bitcoin address from a private key?
I have installed the following library: pip3 install bitcoin in the minimal example below, I am using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04.

        # addresses:
        self.address_compressed = bitcoin.pubkey_to_address(self.public_key_compressed_hex)

    def get_public_key_as_raw_hex_str(self):
        public_key_as_raw_hex_str = bitcoin.encode_pubkey(self.public_key_uncompressed_as_x_y_tuple_hex, 'hex')
        return public_key_as_raw_hex_str

    def get_private_key_as_x_y_tuple(self):
        private_key_raw_decimal_number = bitcoin.decode_privkey(self.private_key_uncompressed_hex, 'hex')
        return bitcoin.fast_multiply(bitcoin.G, private_key_raw_decimal_number)

    def get_compressed_public_key_hex(self):
        (public_key_x, public_key_y) = self.public_key_uncompressed_as_x_y_tuple_hex
        return self.get_compressed_prefix(public_key_y) + bitcoin.encode(public_key_x, 16)

    @staticmethod

                I don't know if it is most popular library but it is very old - last version was released in 2014 - see on pypi. And maybe it doesn't work with shorter addresses. On its repo on GitHub you can see link to newer version but created by different person and you have install it from GitHub.

                @furas I have build my code following the book ""Mastering bitcoin"" where this library was recommended. Unfortunately pybitcointools itself is very poorly documented. I will try the Gitlab version for the very unlikely case that there is just a bug in the version of pybitcointools I have.

                if there is no documentation then you may try to read source code - maybe there will be comments or docstrings - or you can see how function works and what other functions it uses, etc.. Eventually you may try to use help(command) to see docstrings without reading source code.

                unicode strings must be encoded in utf-8 can means this code was created for Python 2 or someone forgot encode it in one place. OR maybe it runs different code for shorter address and only this code has this mistake (maybe nobody convert this part for Python 3).

                Every time you restart ganache it will launch with a new network id, and start with a fresh blockchain. If you want to reuse an address make sure to launch ganache with a persisten id and blockchain.

My first thought was to have a function to check for block validity. Now that can be triggered by the node on a timer, by a push of a button by the node, when new block is added etc. Is there any other way to validate a blockchain when there is actually a change? For example, when a 'hacker' tampered with a block, it triggers the function/script.

Another question, does a database have the functionality to detect change automatically? For example, does MySQL, MonggoDB, etc. have functionalities that can detect when a change is made and notify  an app that there was a change?",databaseblockchain,,Firdaus Indradhirmaya,"Blocks are validated as they are received... otherwise they are not accepted atall. Accepted blocks cannot be changed (or all further blocks rooted from them wouldn't be valid either), so don't need revalidated. This is kindof a main concept that makes blockchains effective. Yes most databases have methods to detect changes and notify apps - from Triggers all the way to Message Broker and SqlChangeNotification in .Net

Passing a variable from cobra command to another,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60743196/passing-a-variable-from-cobra-command-to-another,0,1,874,https://i.stack.imgur.com/kfnvM.jpg?s=32&g=1,"Mar 18, 2020 at 15:59",445,med.b,https://stackoverflow.com/users/6566294/med-b,Passing a variable from cobra command to another,"2 years, 11 months ago","2 years, 11 months ago","I'm working on a Go app that launches a blockchain p2p nodes. For now the user has to manually start the p2p nodes and submit data via terminal. I'm trying to add a HTTP server to add/read data from the blockchain via REST.
The problem is that I'm handling the starting of the p2p nodes with Cobra CLI, so when I added another command to start a go-gin HTTP server. Starting the first p2p node returns a reference to the blockchain, and I'm struggling to pass that reference to the function that starts the http server.

structs:

type P2pConfig struct {
    ListenF int
    Target string
    Secio bool
    Seed int64
}

type HttpConfig struct {
    HttpPort string
}

type Block struct {
    Index     int
    Timestamp string
    BPM       string
    Hash      string
    PrevHash  string
}

type Chain struct {
    BlockChain []Block
    P2pConfig *P2pConfig
    HttpConfig *HttpConfig
}

func NewBlockChain(c *P2pConfig, h *HttpConfig) *Chain {
    return &Chain {
        P2pConfig:c,
        HttpConfig:h,
    }
}


Cobra command to start a p2p node 

func init() {
    CommandServe = &cobra.Command{
        Use:   ""bc"",
        Short: ""Start the BlockChain"",
        Long:  ``,
        Run: func(CommandServe *cobra.Command, args []string) {

            if _, err := serve(); err != nil {
                fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
            }
        },
    }

    CommandServe.Flags().IntVar(&p2pPort, ""l"", 8199, ""port: wait for incoming connections"")
    CommandServe.Flags().StringVar(&target, ""d"", """", ""target peer to dial"")
    CommandServe.Flags().BoolVar(&secio, ""secio"", true, ""enable secio"")
    CommandServe.Flags().Int64Var(&seed, ""seed"", 0, ""set random seed for id generation"")
    CommandServe.Flags().StringVar(&httpPort, ""p"", "":8090"", ""port of the http ledger"")

}

func serve() (*core.Chain, error) {

    c := core.NewBlockChain(&core.P2pConfig{
        ListenF: p2pPort,
        Target:  target,
        Secio:   secio,
        Seed:    seed,
    }, &core.HttpConfig{
        HttpPort: httpPort})

    log.Println(""running p2p server"")

    nc, err := core.Launch(c)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return nc, nil

}


Starting the HTTP server

func init() {
    CommandServe = &cobra.Command{
        Use:   ""hs"",
        Short: ""Start the http server"",
        Long:  ``,
        Run: func(CommandServe *cobra.Command, args []string) {
            if err := serve(); err != nil {
                fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
            }
        },
    }
}

func serve() error {

    log.Println(""running http server"")
    go func() error {
        err := nc.Run("":8090"") //causing error here because nc is not recognizable yet
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        return nil
    }()

    return nil
}


The problem is passing the variable nc from the first command to the second command. It cannot be returned because it's inside Init() method, so I tried creating a global variable in the fist command's package, and then access it from the second's command package, but it's always nil and I don't understand why (probably a scope issue).

I tried mixing the two commands into a single one (start the p2p nodes and http server), use go routines and channels to pass nc, but that caused a problem because go routines run in the background, and starting the p2p nodes requires user interactivity.

Is there a better/smoother way to achieve this ?",goblockchainp2pgo-gingo-cobra,"Mar 18, 2020 at 16:23",Jonathan Hall,"Add a comment

This solution should be used to provide the interactions bewtween manufacturers and suppliers. I supposed that in this case there should be a single blockchain ledger with information about manufactured goods. This ledger should be used both by manufacturers (to register new goods) and by suppliers (to update goods: for example, mark some item as delivered).

The Hyperledger Fabric official documentation (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/fabric_model.html#privacy) says that the ledger is strictly linked with a channel: 


  Blockquote
  Hyperledger Fabric employs an immutable ledger on a per-channel basis, as well as chaincode that can manipulate and modify the current state of assets.


So I intended to create a single channel and install 2 different chaincodes on:


chaincode for manufacturers (to register manufactured goods)
chaincode for suppliers (to mark registered goods as delivered)


But when I prepared a demo application, I revealed, that the second chaincode cannot query the items created with the first one (i.e. each chaincode has an isolated ledger). 

How can I deploy the ledger, which should be shared between organizations having various roles (access rights), if I don't want to force all of them (manufacturers and suppliers) to install the full chaincode (containing both 'register goods' and 'mark as delivered' operations) on their environment?

Problems deploying the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60731415/problems-deploying-the-hyperledger-fabric-blockchain-network,0,1,41,https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Zx7H.jpg?s=32&g=1,"Mar 17, 2020 at 23:02",21,Igor Egorov,https://stackoverflow.com/users/12485423/igor-egorov,Problems deploying the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network,"2 years, 11 months ago","2 years, 11 months ago","I'm preparing a deployment scenario for some software solution based on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain ver. 2.0. I've reviewed the official docs and examples, but some points regarding the deployment/support on real-world production environment are still unclear for me.

Let's suppose that the designed blockchain network includes the following participants:


the Software Provider organization, which prepares and supports the basic blockchain infrastructure;
the consortium of N organizations (Org1, Org2, ..., OrgN) participating in business transactions over blockchain network 
each organization in consortium has a system administrator, which is more or less familiar with blockchain technology and Hyperledger Fabric


The approximate deployment scenario I've expected is:


All participants (Software Provider, Org1, Org2, ... OrgN) prepare required identities: choose their certificate authorities (CAs), get X.509 certificates, generate private and public keys for secured connection etc.
The Software Provider deploys the ordering node, creates the system channel and defines the consortium of N organizations. Therefore the Software Provider must obtain public identities (MSPs) of ALL participating organizations.
All organizations in consortium (Org1, Org2, ... OrgN) start at least one peer in their local environment.
The consortium agrees the business rules to be used on production. Based on this, some organization (for example, Org1) should create a business channel with the corresponding chaincode installed on. To do this, Org1 must have MSPs of ALL organizations to configure the business channel for the whole consortium.
All organizations join this business channel and only use their own MSPs (with private data) to be identified in the network.
After that, Org1 installs the agreed chaincode on business channel. The required number of other organizations approves this chaincode. 
When approval is done, Org1 commits the chaincode definition.
Now all organizations can use their own MSPs to interact with the committed chaincode (query ledger data and invoke smart contracts).


Following this scenario I considered, that only 2 organizations (Software Provider and Org1) should somehow obtain public identities (MSPs) of ALL other consortium members. And for other organizations it is enough to use their own private MSPs to be properly authorized in the network.

But in fact at least on step#5 each organization technically must explicitly operate with MSPs of all consortium members. Here is a command to be executed on step#5 by every organization to register an anchor peer:

configtxgen -profile TwoOrgsChannel -outputAnchorPeersUpdate ./output/channel-artifacts/organchors.tx -channelID mychannel -asOrg OrgX


The above-mentioned TwoOrgsChannel profile is defined in channel configuration (configtx.yaml), which in turn contains links to MSPs of all organizations. This means, that during joining the channel every organization must use a local copy of channel configuration (configtx.yaml) and somehow receive local copies of all MSPs in consortium. It raises several questions at once:

a) For production scenario is it really required for every participating organization to have the MSPs of all other consortium members? Looks like it is very uncomfortable for organization administrator to manage this complex configuration manually...

b) Why it is required to initiate anchor peers update explicitly by every organization, although the information about all anchor peers is already specified in initial channel configuration (configtx.yaml) used to prepare the genesis block for channel (by Org1)?

c) What happens, if I skip the anchor peer update step?

d) And, additionally, is there some way in Hyperledger Fabric to add some organization (or even unauthorized participants) having the read-only permission to access the ledger in some channel? For example, what should we do, if the customers someday ask us (as Software Provider) to give the access to ledger to audit companies?

Could you please clarify these points?

Thanks & Regards

How to change CouchDB version for Hyperledger Fabric?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60218354/how-to-change-couchdb-version-for-hyperledger-fabric,0,1,350,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5360349273b4fb5d742eb58bd6cba5e3?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Feb 14, 2020 at 0:19",659,Skadoosh,https://stackoverflow.com/users/9188188/skadoosh,How to change CouchDB version for Hyperledger Fabric?,3 years ago,3 years ago,"I am trying to run the BYFN first network sample for Hyperledger Fabric v1.4. I am able to start the network by giving command ""sh byfn.sh -m up"" (after setting up binaries and pre-requisites of course). The test runs well and the chaincode is started on peers and an output is produced as well. 

But when I try to start the same network with the command ""sh byfn.sh -s couchdb"", the network starts, but there is an error when the peer joins the channel. I have asked about this issue in a separate post here, where you can find the logs -  rpc error - Proposal failed when peer joins channel in Fabric 

There seems to be problem with couchDB version as the logs say, 

> Error during CouchDB
> > CreateDatabaseIfNotExist() for dbName: mychannel_  error: json:
> > cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field DBInfo.purge_seq of type
> > int panic: Error during commit to txmgr:json: cannot unmarshal string
> > into Go struct field DBInfo.purge_seq of type int


Now I guess the couchDb version for fabric v1.4 is v2.3 , how do I use a different version or a different image of couchdb so that I can check for the same? I have been through this issue for a while and not able to find a solution.",couchdbhyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledger,"Feb 14, 2020 at 9:15",Jonathan Hall,"looks like you need this fix in fabric 2.0 to use any version: github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/… otherwise you would need to use couch 2.2-, probably by editing the docker configurations byfn.sh relies on.

Is there anything to configure for invoking with the first one I mean except passing the --peerAddresses param?
I have also added the third organization from here. And here the invoke command also work i mean valid transaction.

peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050  --tls true --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{""Args"":[""invoke"",""a"",""b"",""10""]}'

So, why does not the same invoke is not working for the byfn?
Note for byfn I have removed the all images and done it from the beginning. So here is no conflict actually.",hyperledger-fabricblockchainhyperledger,"Jun 20, 2020 at 9:12",Community,"Add a comment

I try to send one Ether from one account to another and even though I get the transaction hash, the transaction doesn't go through. I've already read that gas price might be too low, but again it didn't work as I set it to even 5.000.000. When I call web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt('txHash'), it returns null, so I guess the transaction failed.

Here is my code:

            gasPrice: toHex(web3.utils.toWei('12', 'gwei'))
        }

        // Sign the transaction
        const tx = new Tx(txObject);
        tx.sign(pk2);

        const serializedTx = tx.serialize();
        const raw = '0x' + serializedTx.toString('hex')

        // Broadchast the transaction to the network
        web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(raw, (err, txHash) => {
            console.log('txHash:', txHash);

            web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash, (err, receipt) => {
                console.log('receipt: ', receipt);

                if (receipt == null) {
                    // Render the page
                    res.render('sendTransaction', {

var Election = artifacts.require(""./Election.sol"");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Election );
};


When I do truffle migrate using command -truffle migrate, I get this error.

                yeah I did. I can install my composer on org3 (so the ca is fine because whenever the ca is broken I always failed to install it) but I can't seem too start the network. for other file wait a minute, I'll edit it

I have already created one custom blockchain with:


Nodes - mine, add transaction, broadcast and more
BlockChain - for each nodes to maintain their local blocks
Wallet - Each node having wallet to maintain their amount
Transaction - To have transaction record in ordered way and having hash functions and more


But Right now I want to try to create one smart contract from scratch on my custom block chain but I am not sure how to do it. I am new in this field so any help on this ?

I just want to be able to use any one of the smart contract feature in my custom block chain without using etherium.",blockchaincryptocurrency,,Shashank Sharma,"Add a comment

Currently I'm using this function:

auxData = data.encode()
auxData = binascii.hexlify(auxData)


but that just returns a byte object,

i have also tried: 

        auxData = data.encode()
        auxData = binascii.hexlify(auxData)  
        while(len(auxData)<32):
            auxData = auxData + aux


that loop is supposed to ensure that the object has all 32 digits as a bytes16 should have.

All of this is to send a bytes16 to a Smart Contract in my private ethereum blockchain. We have a contract Factory but I can't call the needed function because the objects types doesn't match.

Changing the data types to just bytes will double the gas consumption.

But how to achieve a provably fair and cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) on hyperledger ?

My first assumption was to get a random number from the consensus algorithm but a validator could manipulate the current block to his advantage if he sends the transaction only with his manipulated block.

Later I developed this algorithm which should work but is hard to implement:

for every block:
   every validator:
   1. generates new temporary privkey and pubkey
   2. makes a raw transaction to the next validators pubkey
   3. transfers his privkey to the blockchain after a block was broadcasted
   4. verifies every privkey which belongs to a pubkey on the blockchain
   5. calculates H(blockhash | privkey1 | privkey2 | ... | privkeyn) as new random number


I think this is really interesting for gambling applications, too.

So what is the easiest way for my problem? Should I realize the algorithm shown above?",cryptographyhyperledger-fabrichyperledgerblockchainhyperledger-sawtooth,,kAhmij,"Add a comment

I'm implementing a trustless blockchain service. Users need to solve captchas that are validated with Google by a central server. For most web apps this would be enough. But this is decentralized, so... For my web app the server also needs to present proof they actually solved the captcha (that the server didn't just make up ""yeah this user solved a captcha"" when they didn't).

I thought that the server could make public the user's response token, but others still wouldn't be able to re-verify that the response token was actually valid. And to my knowledge, there is no field that relates a response token with google's true/false response for that particular request.

Fabric 1.3

What I did:


Stop Orderer2.
docker stop orderer2.example.com
Execute invoke from SDK

Expected Behaviour


Since orderer2.example.com is stopped, now I expected that the SDK should make request to orderer.example.com for failover.

Actual Behaviour


The SDK makes request to orderer2.example.com only.
Error occurs in the SDK.

The sample yaml file is shown below.

channels:
  mychannel:
    orderers:

So in the case of identity, only admin is there. There is also documentation to create and issue other identities to login into the business networks.   

But still, the problem is it's only in a single peer, meaning my local machine. To my understanding, for the hyperledger to function as decentralized and distributed ledger system, additional peers have to be added to the channel and then states gets synced in those peers. Hence if one node is down, details can be obtained from other nodes. 

I checked some links such as this and this. But all of these point to the things that :   


Existing network should be stopped and teared down.
The IP address of the second machine should be manually added to the docker.yml file and then have to be restarted.


My doubts are :   


But on doing this, won't the existing ledger stated be cleared? All the data are gone.
So before even creating a dApp using hyperledger, we have to include all the IP address of the machine in the yml and start the network?
How to actually implement the distributed-decentralised ledger system for a hyperleder network?


UPDATE :  

I have checked the links mentioned by Paul O'Mahony. The links explains about the peer addition steps. Overall what happens there is :  


downloaded the fabric sample as the fabric extension is only possible through the cryptogen version appropriate to the Fabric version. 
Currently contains order, org1 & org2 (with 2 peers each). 
To add a new peer along with its couchdb, changed the template count in the crypto-config.yaml and created crypto material for the new peer using the extend command.
Then using the docker composer file to spawn a new peer and its couchdb. This will create new containers.
Finally the created peers should be joined to the existing channel for the couch db to get sync. The adding to existing channel is via logging into the docker container and typing some cli commands and adding the peer to channel via channel join command.


Is this recommend way to add peers to the channel ? Suppose i am creating a network and wanted to add peers to the channel based on a condition. Like a user/users can add themselves to the network through a login via composer playground and act as a peer. So i have to follow the same steps to do it ? Is this the recommended way ?

                1. You can add a peer without tearing down existing 2. the new peer should be accessible by the other containers by name/IP. 3. Users are not 'added' to a Fabric channel - in Composer, you create a business network card (see hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/playground/… and hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/managing/… ) to understand more. They interact with a business network (smart contract, dApp), deployed to Fabric with that card (that contains their blockchain identity - not to be confused with app user id).

[ ""From"", ""to"", ""object"", [ ""rules1"", ""rules2""]], [[1, ""data1""], [2, ""data2""], [3, ""data3""]]


This is my code:

pragma experimental ""v0.5.0"";
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract StructContract {

    struct Certificate{
        uint id;
        string data;
    }

    struct StructEvent {
        string _from;
        string _to;
        string _object;
        string[] _rules;
    }

    StructEvent structEvent;
    Certificate[] certificate;

    function setEvent(StructEvent eventS,Certificate[] eventC)  public{
            certificate.length=0;
            structEvent = eventS;
            for(uint i=0;i<(eventC.length);i++){
              certificate.push(Certificate(eventC[i].id,eventC[i].data));
            }
    }
    function getStruct() view public returns(StructEvent){
        return(structEvent);
    }
    function getCertificate() view public returns(Certificate[]){
        return(certificate);
    }
    function returnAllData() view public returns(StructEvent,Certificate[]){
        return(structEvent,certificate);
    }

}


once this is done, what I expect is that these data are put into a transaction that is then uploaded to blockchain. Then I have to take the data in these transactions to perform checks on them.

So I need to have data that are put on blockchain, as a solution to this problem I created this code: (I use web3 1.0.0-beta.36)

function printTransaction(txHash) {

  web3.eth.getTransaction(txHash, function (error, tx) {
    if (tx != null) {
      var inputData = tx.input;
      try {
        var myContract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, tx.to);
        var result = web3.eth.abi.decodeParameters(['tuple(string,string,string,string[])',
          'tuple(uint,string)[]'], inputData.slice(10));
        var data1 = result[0];
        var data2 = result[1];
        console.log(""\n\n"");
        console.log(""--- transactions ---"");
        console.log(""   tx hash         : "" + tx.hash + ""\n""
          + ""   nonce           : "" + tx.nonce + ""\n""
          + ""   blockHash       : "" + tx.blockHash + ""\n""
          + ""   blockNumber     : "" + tx.blockNumber + ""\n""
          + ""   transactionIndex: "" + tx.transactionIndex + ""\n""
          + ""   from            : "" + tx.from + ""\n""
          + ""   to              : "" + tx.to + ""\n""
          + ""   value           : "" + tx.value + ""\n""
          + ""   gasPrice        : "" + tx.gasPrice + ""\n""
          + ""   gas             : "" + tx.gas + ""\n""
          + ""   input           : "" + tx.input + ""\n""
          + ""   decodeinput     : "" + ""\n""
          + ""                     Struct          : "" + data1 + ""\n""
          + ""                     Certificates    : "" + data2);

        web3.eth.getAccounts(function (err, account) {
          myContract.methods.setEvent(data1, data2).send({ from: account[0], gas: 3000000 }, function (err, resul) {
            if (err) {
              console.log(""err"");
            } else {
              console.log(""\n\n"");
              console.log(""--- data ---"");
              myContract.methods.returnAllData().call().then(console.log);
            }
          });
        });
      } catch (Error) { }
    }
  });
}


What I decided to do is create, in a js file, a method that was able to take the transactions, decode the input related to the data contained in it and pass this data, through the send, to my smart contract in which it will be used.

these methods that I created represent the right solution? or I have to use another kind of approach, another method to do this?

As of my understanding, in pruning mode fast, parity will sync all of the blocks in the ethereum blockchain and store in the local storage. However, it only sync recent snapshots and only them will be stored in the local storage. I am correct?
So what happened when I query historical snapshots that were not stored in the hard disk. Will parity take the oldest snapshot and blocks to calculate that ancient snapshots? Will it find an archive node and query that?",blockchainethereumparity-io,,Viet Thang Dinh,"Add a comment

Docker 18.06.1-ce


It works fine from a standard Java Spring based application, basically this way (reading crypto materials from local webapps folder) :

public void init() {
    Security.addProvider(new org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider());

    HFClient client = HFClient.createNewInstance();

    CryptoSuite cryptoSuite = CryptoSuite.Factory.getCryptoSuite();
    client.setCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite);

    User myOrgAdmin = new AppUser(""Admin"", ORG1_ADMIN_PK, ORG1_ADMIN_PEM, ""MyOrgMSP"");
    client.setUserContext(myOrgAdmin);

    Channel ciChannel = client.newChannel(""ci-channel"");

    Properties ordererProperties = new Properties();
    ordererProperties.setProperty(""pemFile"", ORDERER_CERT);
    ordererProperties.setProperty(""hostnameOverride"", ORDERER_NAME);

    ciChannel.initialize();
}


But I can't make it work when moving to a Spring Boot application packaged as JAR.

Indeed when dealing with JAR file and embedded Tomcat, I can not specify paths to crypto files. I have to use ClassPathResource and I can only get files as streams.

So instead of using pemFile to specify the certificates, I use pemBytes this way (crypto-config folder has been added as resource) :

private final static String ORG1_PEER0_NAME = ""peer0.myorg.ch"";
private final static String ORG1_PEER0_ADDRESS = ""grpcs://peer0.myorg.ch:7051"";

private final static String ORG1_ADMIN_PEM = ""peerOrganizations/myorg.ch/users/Admin@myorg.ch/msp/signcerts/Admin@myorg.ch-cert.pem"";

private final static String ORDERER_NAME = ""orderer.myorg.ch"";
private final static String ORDERER_ADDRESS = ""grpcs://orderer.myorg.ch:7050"";
private final static String ORDERER_CERT = ""ordererOrganizations/myorg.ch/orderers/orderer.myorg.ch/tls/server.crt"";

public void init() {
    Security.addProvider(new org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider());

    HFClient client = HFClient.createNewInstance();

    CryptoSuite cryptoSuite = CryptoSuite.Factory.getCryptoSuite();
    client.setCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite);

    User myOrgAdmin = new AppUser(""Admin"", ORG1_ADMIN_PK, ORG1_ADMIN_PEM, ""MyOrgMSP"");
    client.setUserContext(myOrgAdmin);

    Channel ciChannel = client.newChannel(""ci-channel"");

    Properties ordererProperties = new Properties();
    ordererProperties.put(""pemBytes"", FileCopyUtils.copyToByteArray(new ClassPathResource(ORDERER_CERT).getInputStream()));

    ordererProperties.put(""grpc.NettyChannelBuilderOption.keepAliveTimeout"", new Object[]{8L, TimeUnit.SECONDS});
    Orderer orderer = client.newOrderer(ORDERER_NAME, ORDERER_ADDRESS, ordererProperties);

    ciChannel.addOrderer(orderer);
    ciChannel.addPeer(peer0MyOrg, Channel.PeerOptions.createPeerOptions().setPeerRoles(EnumSet.of(Peer.PeerRole.SERVICE_DISCOVERY, Peer.PeerRole.LEDGER_QUERY, Peer.PeerRole.EVENT_SOURCE, Peer.PeerRole.CHAINCODE_QUERY)));

I’m getting an error when it tries to add an object to the blockchain:

Error: 5 NOT_FOUND: Resource not found (resource=blockchain-transactions)


This is coming from this line here:

const pubsub = new PubSub();
pubsub.topic(‘blockchain-transactions').publisher().publish(signedBlockTransaction);


The call to publish(signedBlockTransaction) is throwing the error.

All I can understand about this error is that it’s looking for a resource called ‘blockchain-transaction’ and it can’t find it. But beyond this, I’m not sure why it can’t find it or how to fix it (I didn’t write the code).

One thing that may be affecting it is the following:

I was dealing with a different error which I managed to get by but I don’t know if I did it the right way. The error was:

Cannot read property ‘privatekey’ of undefined


…when trying to execute this line:

functions.config().blockchain.privatekey


It turns out .runtimeconfig.json was empty, literally only containing {}

So in an attempt to give it a private key, I went to my file id_rsa which contain a private key for something or other (I think github) and added it like so:

{
    ""blockchain"": {
        “privatekey"": *** my private key ***
    }
}


That got me past the first error, but I understood the private key I gave it probably isn’t the one it’s looking for.

So my question is: is the error I’m encountering now a consequence of the wrong private key? If not, what is the cause of the error, and how do I fix it?

In short, I have been testing small Node.js scripts with Web3.js to post thermometer readings to a smart contract and after the transaction is mined to get back the last 5 values posted. 

I haven't found a specific Web3 method to do so, so I coded a .on method in Node.js. I am now looking for more optimised ways of doing it and together to query if there is a way of doing it using any of the Web3 methods.

PS - I suppressed the smart contract and parts of the Node script to save space on the post.

Cheers,

// Transaction
web3.eth.getTransactionCount(account1, (err, txCount) => {

  const txObject = {
    nonce:    web3.utils.toHex(txCount),
    gasLimit: web3.utils.toHex(100000),
    gasPrice: web3.utils.toHex(web3.utils.toWei('1', 'gwei')),
    to: contractAddress,
    data: contract.methods.postTemperature((Date.now() / 1000 | 0), temp).encodeABI()
  }

  const tx = new Tx(txObject)
  tx.sign(privateKey1)

  const serializedTx = tx.serialize()
  const raw = '0x' + serializedTx.toString('hex')

  web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(raw, (err, txHash) => {
      txH = txHash;

./rai_node --daemon

I created an account and from NANEX made a transfer to that account of some NANO coins.
I checked in the explorer
https://www.nanode.co
and it shows the payment and the HASH, and shows it as un-pocketed yet.

To complete the opening of the new account, I followed the steps of the manual below, but it fails:
https://www.nanode.co/docs#rpc-guide-connecting

In step 1 of the above manual:
The RPC command “accounts_pending” returns an empty string and not the HASH that appears in the Explorer above.
For the RPC command I used both “curl” and the nodejs library “axios” that writes in the online manual.

With “curl”:

curl -g -d
‘{“action”: “accounts_pending”,“accounts”: [“xrb_acountnumber”],“count”: 1}’
‘[::ffff:127.0.0.1]:7076’

With nodejs:

// Step 1. Retrieve hash of the send block that you sent from your wallet

const pending = await rpc.post(’/’, {
action: ‘accounts_pending’,
accounts: [“xrb_acountnumber”]
})

The above are not working even after I manually downloaded the Nano_blockchain into my local client and it is almost synchronized.

Also in the step no 4:

// Step 4. Publish your open block to the network using ""process""

const processResult = await rpc.post(’/’, {
action: ‘process’,
block: newBlock.data.block
})
console.log(processResult.data.hash) // The hash of your newly published open block

it returns the error:

data: { error: ‘Gap source block’ } }

instead of the hash of your newly published open block

2) On what basis blocks get generated in fabric. I have gone through config.go file and have referred BatchSize parameter but if my txn size is very less (say ~5kb) then does that mean that no block will get generated until it reaches PreferredMaxBytes or MaxMessageCount ?

Why does including a module in an active record model cause the model to be redefined as a normal ruby class?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51951397/why-does-including-a-module-in-an-active-record-model-cause-the-model-to-be-rede,0,1,80,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c316d4d0ba444485f8546c2a56ad3cdb?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Aug 21, 2018 at 14:51",19,P. Maina,https://stackoverflow.com/users/10255212/p-maina,Why does including a module in an active record model cause the model to be redefined as a normal ruby class?,"4 years, 6 months ago","4 years, 6 months ago","I have an Active Record model (Listing) that should store some properties in the database while some other properties will be stored in a blockchain (ethereum). 

Ideally when a developer does model_record.save, the active record save method should be overridden to firstly save the appropriate properties in the blockchain and later proceed to do the normal activerecord save. This procedure applies to most other methods like .update, .destroy, .create.

The following has been achieved by adding a macros level declaration in the model to distinguish the blockchain properties from the normal active record columns

class Listing < ApplicationRecord
   include BlockchainRecord

   self.table_name = ""listings""
   blockchain_properties :parcel_no,
                         :description
end


A module BlockchainRecord has also been included inside the model and includes methods like the ones shown below

module BlockchainRecord

  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  ...............


  class_methods do
    def blockchain_properties(*props)
      @@blockchain_attributes = props


      define_method :blockchain_attributes do
        props
      end

      props.each do |prop|
        define_method prop do
          if self.instance_variable_defined?(""@#{prop}"")
            self.instance_variable_get(""@#{prop}"") 
          else
            if self.address
              val = self.contract.call.send(""#{prop}"") 
              self.instance_variable_set(""@#{prop}"", val)
              val
            else
              nil
            end
          end
        end

        # Setter methods
        define_method ""#{prop}="" do |arg|
          self.instance_variable_set(""@#{prop}"", arg)
        end
      end
    end

    def new(props = {})
      model_record = super(props.except(blockchain_attributes))

      blockchainProps = props.slice(*blockchain_attributes)
      blockchainProps.each do |k, v|
        model_record.send(""#{k}="", v)
      end

      return model_record
    end
  end

  def save
    if self.address
      blockchain_attributes.each do |prop|
        self.contract.transact_and_wait.send(""set_#{prop}"", self.send(""#{prop}"")) 
        sleep(2)
      end
      super
    else
      # in case we call Class.new then Object.save
      contract = Ethereum::Contract.create(file: self.class.contract_file_path)
      key = Eth::Key.new(priv: ENV[""PRIVATE_KEY""])
      contract.key = key
      self.address = contract.deploy_and_wait(*(self.attributes.slice(*blockchain_attributes).values))
      super
    end
  end

end


The problem occurs when one finishes saving an activerecord object, then later tries something like Model.count or Model.all. 

For example if i did, 
l = Listing.new(parcel_no: 1234, description: ""..."", registration_section: ""..."") then saved the record l.save, that would store the blockchain properties (parcel_no and description) correctly and later call the .save provided by ActiveRecord to save the rest of the attributes to the database. 

However, when i make a subsequent call like Listing.count, that fails with the following error message NoMethodError: undefined method count for Listing:Class, and when i check the ancestors of Listing i get [Listing, ActiveSupport::ToJsonWithActiveSupportEncoder, Object, PP::ObjectMixin, MakeMakefile, ActiveSupport::Dependencies::Loadable, JSON::Ext::Generator::GeneratorMethods::Object, ActiveSupport::Tryable, Kernel, BasicObject] which just means it no longer inherits from active record base

Why does the overriding of this activerecord .save method in the module cause Listing model to no longer inherit from ActiveRecord::Base and how can that be fixed ?",ruby-on-railsrubyblockchain,"Aug 21, 2018 at 21:51",,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                I am very unclear on your question here but a traditional rails ""Model"" is always a Class (it uses inheritance from the ActiveRecord::Base class) including a Module does not change this.

                @P. Maina, because you said ""the save method should be overridden to firstly save the appropriate properties in the blockchain and later proceed to do the normal activerecord save"", I believe you would want to use prepend instead of include, because you want some code to be executed first before running normally, unlike if you use include it runs normally first then if the normal method has super on it, that's only the time when your ""included"" code gets called. Yours seemed to have worked because coincidentally I believe Rails has multiple ancestor classes that calls super.

Bankera GitHub script to redeem commissions - How does it works?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51378828/bankera-github-script-to-redeem-commissions-how-does-it-works,0,1,38,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18fa406244f4d2974e9dfd0f413c1faa?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Jul 17, 2018 at 10:15",386,Benny,https://stackoverflow.com/users/10093017/benny,Bankera GitHub script to redeem commissions - How does it works?,"4 years, 7 months ago","4 years, 7 months ago","First of all, I have contacted Bankera and no help is offered because this is an open source script. I have then contacted their community in their live chat and no one has any clues on how this script works(but would love to know) this is why I turned to Stack Overflow to get some help, this post will help a lot of users.
I have to redeem commissions on some of my tokens, the problem is that I need to run this script to get them:
https://github.com/Bankera-token/BNK-ETH-Contract

As it says at the top:
The Contract has to have an Ethereum address in order to deposit a reward. Once the reward is set up for the weekly round, the claim amount will be proportionally divided among round token holders. For example, Jack, John and Bob have 1, 2 and 2 tokens respectively. If 100 ethers are placed in the round as a reward, Jack, John and Bob can claim 20, 40, 40 ethers respectively through the smart contract.

I ran the first 2 commands and it created a node_module folder with all the dependencies required.

start init.sh
npm i


I then ran this command:

start runrpc.sh
start run.sh


All I see is a black screen for 1/2 second and disappear.

Where in this script shall I set my address to redeem the commission?

And also how can I run the functions from this script? I have a PHP background but I am zero with Bash and Blockchain.

I am on windows 10.

I have looked everywhere for help, no one in the community knows how this works

Thank you.",blockchain,,Benny,"I think the linked Github is actually the token contract, so you don't have to run that. You can find the Contract ABI in the Bankera ERC20 Contract here. Here's a tutorial which shows how you can call the contract method claimReward from MEW. It's in italian but you should be able to follow the steps done in MEW

This is obviously a conflict in allocating addresses, as it's not reading the correct address of the BankFactory.

Javascript.

The signature of my Solidity function looks like this

function getSomeIds() public view returns (uint[])


Now after I created some elements within my contract, and run above function in the interactive Truffle console I get the following (which is perfectly correct):

$ app.getSomeIds()
  [BigNumber {s:1, e:0, c[1]},
   BigNumber {s:1, e:0, c[0]}]


The problem with this is, that I cannot access elements of the returned array the common way, since web3 does not receive it as an array but as an object

$ array = app.getSomeIds()
$ array[0]
  undefined

$ typeof(array)
  'object'


So how can I access the elements of the array?",blockchainsolidityweb3web3jstruffle,,Sebastian Dine,"Are you surely working with web3 in latter example? In web3, contract functions are called somewhat like this contractInstance.methods.nameOfContractMethod().call(). Note that call() is async, so you need to properly handle the asynchronicity.

                @PatrikStas I get the contract instance like this: ContactId.deployed().then(function(instance){ app = instance}) After this I can call contract functions like I did above in the truffle console.

I'm taking each field, converting it to hex if neccesary, reversing the bytes so its in little endian format, concatenating all that together, and doing a double sha256 hash on it. I would expect to arrive at the block hash of;

Questions:

Whenever a customer requests to participate in the ksi blockchain then he submits the hash of his data to the ksi gateway. Then in return he gets a token, which is basically a proof of his participation.
What exactly does this token contain?

Through his token he can later on verify his data integrity as the token contains path in the Merkle tree from his leaf node and way up to the hash in the calendar ledger. 
How is this path attached to the token exactly, and how is it computed?

Is it first computed at the ledger level and then passed down the aggregation networks and then to the requestor?",blockchainbitcoinmerkle-tree,"Apr 28, 2018 at 10:32",Robin Green,"I have removed my other questions as asked by you @CollinD ..

                Ans  token contains the hash values of the siblings and the order in which they appear , i.e, either left or right.  To recompute the path only these values are sufficient and these hash values of the sibling are passed down from up to down direction i.e, from core cluster -> aggregators -> gateway.

                how are you trying to access to this code? To connect to rinkeby just use metamask and, since you inject the provider correctly, you might be able to execute the code (changing the network metamask network to rinkeby). to change the status to view, just modify your method signature in this way function balanceOfTestCoin() public view returns (uint amount)

I am facing issue with Makeblock when retrieving the Hash Value created in Genesis Block and stored in a text file.

Below is the error Message :

Code Snippet are below :

Within a Kafka based ordering environment we have:
Zookeeper nodes
Kafka nodes
Orderer Nodes
Peer Nodes

Within this environment which of these would effect scalability most or at all? 

I am currently writing scripts to test a wide range of network architectures and I am hoping to understand how each component effects the performance through empirical evidence. If I am able to add some form of logic to my testing basis I should be able to understand my results a little better.",apache-kafkaapache-zookeeperblockchainhyperledger-fabric,,zonked,"Have you made any progress ?

Each Outbox can write Messages(Assets) to the Blockchain.

However, only the company to which the Outbox belongs should be allowed to view/edit etc the message. 

So far I've managed to get most of this running, but as of now I still can create new transactions where the message belongs to company 1 and is sent by Outbox 2, which should belong to company 2. 

How do I resolve this so that it is impossible to create a Message that belongs to a company 1 and simultaneously to an outbox 2 that itself doesn't belong to company 1?

asset Message identified by messageId {
o String messageId
o String text
--> Company writerCompany
--> App writerApp

abstract participant Member identified by memberId{
    o String memberId
    o String memberName

participant App identified by appId{

participant Auditor extends Member{

what is the efficient format to store it in ledger? should I convert to string or keep that as a []byte, considering that this json will be sent as a parameter from a client to chaincode. any examples about the data formats should be used in this scenario.

So it will be just numeric from 1 to 99999999.
When I create a new record I want to assign it id, so i guess, I need to get last record and grab that id, so how can I grab only last record?
I think only of is GetStateByRange and then iterating through all keys, but that doesn't sound very efficient.",blockchainhyperledger-fabrichyperledger,,NIck,"Adding autogenerated ids that rely on the ledger is not a very good idea according to me. Doing this will centralize your dependency of generating an ID on a single key and you have to increment and persist it in the blockchain every time you require an ID. If you are running concurrent transactions you would run into Optimistic Locking failures causing an MVCC_READ_CONFLICT (stackoverflow.com/questions/45347439/…). Try using some random keys or atleast invert the dependency of ID generation in Client App.

                Thanks for reply, I thought about random Id, but it may have collssions on big numbers and it will have even more collissions, won't it? In my app I don't really need id because I will index ledger by composite key, but i definitly need to have id,  otherwise I won't be able to put smth into the ledger.

It seems the NP-hard verification step can be resolved if you allow for multiple parallel blockchains with different sets of blocks in the head of each version. This of course creates another problem of trying to reconcile multiple blockchains in a secure manner.

The go-to proof-of-work method of reconciliation seems to be ""take whichever chain has the most work in it,"" but is there anything out there already which allows for the reconciliation of the blocks without a loss of proof or transactional data?",blockchain,,CoryG,"1

I am finding it hard to comprehend what this means. It would be great if someone could help understand this with an example.


Value Blindness:



  There is no way for a UTXO script to provide
  fine-grained control over the amount that can be withdrawn. For
  example, one powerful use case of an oracle contract would be a
  hedging contract, where A and B put in $1000 worth of BTC and after 30
  days the script sends $1,000 worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This
  would require an oracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD[Note
  3], but even then it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and
  infrastructure requirement over the fully centralized solutions that
  are available now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the only
  way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of having
  many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO of 2k for every k up
  to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to send to A and which to B.



Blockchain-blindness



  UTXO are blind to certain blockchain data such as the nonce and
  previous block hash. This severely limits applications in gambling,
  and several other categories, by depriving the scripting language of a
  potentially valuable source of randomness.",bitcoinblockchainethereum,"Jul 31, 2017 at 11:04",Antoine C.,"Add a comment

In the setup part of the code, the following can be found:

for (var i = 0; i < peers.length; i++) {
    // Peers on Bluemix require secured connections, hence 'grpcs://'
    peerUrls.push(""grpcs://"" + peers[i].discovery_host + "":"" + peers[i].discovery_port);
    chain.addPeer(peerUrls[i], {
        pem: cert
    });

   eventUrls.push(""grpcs://"" + peers[i].event_host + "":"" + peers[i].event_port);

    chain.eventHubConnect(eventUrls[0], {
        pem: cert
    });

}


When I run the whole helloblockchain.js code, the message ""Successfully submitted chaincode invoke transaction..."" is displayed and the program stops.  I was expecting to see the message ""Successfully completed chaincode invoke transaction..."" to appear next but this did not happen.

To check what is causing the problem, I removed the following lines:

    chain.eventHubConnect(eventUrls[0], {
        pem: cert
    });


When I try it again, the code is working properly.  

Based on this, the eventHub has a negative effect on the code.  

However, I cannot afford not to use eventHub since I need to know if the invocation of my chaincode is successful or not. Is there a particular configuration that needs to be done to make eventHub work in HFC?",ibm-cloudblockchainhyperledgerhyperledger-fabric,"Feb 17, 2017 at 14:34",Chris Sharp,"Have you checked the event port (listed in your ServiceCredentials) to make sure it's open? If so then can are you running this from the master branch? Also, what OS are you using?

                Hi @Chris.  I'm using the Bluemix blockchain service and I confirmed that the event port (31003) is open.  I'm using the master branch (github.com/IBM-Blockchain/SDK-Demo/blob/master/…) for the sample code.  I am using Windows 7 and HFC v0.6.5.  I already tested Ubuntu for this but got the same problem.

I have used IBM Blockchain JS for interacting w/ the go contract.
Below is the node js code

// Step 1 ==================================
var Ibc1 = require('ibm-blockchain-js');
var ibc = new Ibc1(/*logger*/);             //you can pass a logger such as winston here - optional
var chaincode = {};


// ==================================
// configure ibc-js sdk
// ==================================
var options =   {
    network:{
        peers:   [{
            ""api_host"": ""127.0.0.1"",
            ""api_port"": 49155,
            //""api_port_tls"": 49157,
            ""id"": ""vp4""
        }],
        users: null,
        options: {quiet: true, tls:false, maxRetry: 1}
    },
    chaincode:{
        zip_url: 'https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/learn-chaincode/archive/master.zip',
        unzip_dir: 'learn-chaincode-master/finished',    
        git_url: 'https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/learn-chaincode/finished'

    }
};

// Step 2 ==================================
ibc.load(options, cb_ready);

// Step 3 ==================================
function cb_ready(err, cc){                             //response has chaincode functions

chaincode = cc;

   console.log(JSON.stringify(cc));

   chaincode.deploy('init', ['Hi hyperledger'], null, cb_deployed);


// Step 5 ==================================
function cb_deployed(){

    console.log(JSON.stringify(chaincode));
    console.log('sdk has deployed code and waited');

    console.log('******** Writing to chaincode Now **********');
    chaincode.invoke.write([""mykey"",""Hi Ledger Systems""],function(err,data){
    console.log('write response:', data);

   readData();


});
}



function readData()
{

console.log('\n\n**** Waiting 7 seconds before reading **** \n\n');
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('\n\n**** Start reading **** \n\n');

  chaincode.invoke.read([""mykey""],function(err,data){
   console.log('read response:', data);

 });
}, 7000)
}


  }",blockchainhyperledger,"Aug 11, 2016 at 4:59",,"Your link to the chaincode is broken, pointing towards a non-existant page. Please post the chaincode - or at least the relevant query method - in the question. I suspect this might be because the chaincode encountered an error in the query method, which forced the chaincode to stop running, but cannot verify that without access to the chaincode.

                Please edit the relevant code into the question, instead of putting it into a comment. It's very difficult to read when it's in a comment. Also, I was asking for the chaincode, not the js. The chaincode should be written in Go, and should look something like this example. Please post the Query method from your chaincode, as well as the input you're submitting. Also, I do not need to connect to your chaincode, I need to see the source code.

                First thing's first, you're doing chaincode.invoke.read rather than chaincode.query.read. Given that read is a query method, that might cause problems. But it's probably not causing this particular issue. From what I'm reading, it looks like the deployment transaction failed. Are you absolutely sure it deployed/wrote correctly? If so, how do you know? Did you query the blocks directly and see what happened? Maybe try submitting deploying/writing/reading from postman so that you can isolate whether this is a cc issue, or a javascript issue.

                I would start by contacting the developer. There is already an issue open: github.com/blockchain/api-v1-client-php/issues/17 and a pull request to fix the documentation. github.com/c88lopez/api-v1-client-php/commit/… You will probably be able to load the code correctly using the suggested doc correction, but you will first have to familiarize yourself with Composer getcomposer.org

With this change I can interact with the Contract only with account that creates and deploy the smart contract, also, the transactions have no confirmation from the user. However, when I try to call some Contract function with another address I get this error:

On the fourth line, the value of the ""from"" key is different from the address actually selected in the metamask, in fact it is the address of the creator of the Smart Contract. There seems to be some problem with the signer or what? With Web3Provider everything works fine.

Issues while selling to a liquidity pool created for my own smart contract,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75457082/issues-while-selling-to-a-liquidity-pool-created-for-my-own-smart-contract,0,0,18,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJymFfETwyS8GXAPPo2l47eIb4xkBfZ0e6wpmB8u=k-s32,yesterday,11,Arcania,https://stackoverflow.com/users/18541404/arcania,Issues while selling to a liquidity pool created for my own smart contract,yesterday,yesterday,"i've been lately trying to create an ERC20 Token with Some Fees implemented on the transfer functions and an AntiSnipe system which is supposed to block the addresses trying to make a transfer in a certain range of time. As per Uniswap documentation, IUniswapV2Router02 implements methods which accepts transfers with fees and in fact the system works in part.
Basically, after i deploy on Goerli, i am able to create a liquidity pool and with a 2nd wallet, i'm able to either buy or sell from the liquidity pool once.
After the first buy or sell, noone is able to either buy or sell anymore.
Considering that the first buy/sell works, and my 3rd wallet actually receives the fees, i suppose the way i've wrote TransferFrom function is right.
It feels like the liquidity pool Reserves dont gets updated after the first transfer and this brings the 2nd to fail (Just an idea, i have no message errors at all)
The transfer function has this logic inside aswell, but with msg.sender instead of from.

                The sniper bot logic is pretty pointless, that logic is only relavent to LP pairs once deployed not really your token. You also have  vulnerability where they can block anyones address if they decide to modify the to column instead of sniping to themselves

I've previously built projects utilising the likes of coingecko, bscscan API etc... Which were perfect for the intended use-case, however now starting a new project I'm requiring informatiom which is proving problematic to obtain.
I'm trying to find a way to query a token address and obtain transaction information, such as how much BNB was spent in the transaction, and how many tokens were received in return.
With the tokens I'm trying to do this with, the majority of purchases are < 1BNB and as a result, BSCScan api returns 0 in the value key:value pair, as well as not providing the token quantities received.
While it would be nice to have access to token amounts received, it isn't absolutely necessary as I could produce this providing I had access to the amount spent on the transaction.
Outside of the commonly known APIs, is there a way to obtain this information?
I apologise if this is an obvious question, but with how transparent blockchain explorers are, I'm struggling to believe that there isn't some way to obtain this information, and struggling even further to figure out how to gain access to it.",apiblockchaincryptocurrencybinance-smart-chainbsc,,lariz,"Add a comment

I can't convince myself since the following reasons:

Inheriting interface needs to write the interface first.

Hi everyone,
I am developing a zk rollup SDK and I need help with defining the constraints for the circuit. I do not have access to a cryptography expert at the moment and I am looking for resources or community members who can help me.
I am using the circomlib library and I have a basic understanding of zk-SNARKs, but I am not sure how to define the constraints for the circuit. My inputs include the following:

parentHash
sha3Uncles
miner
stateRoot
transactionsRoot
receiptsRoot
logsBloom
difficulty
totalDifficulty
size
number
gasLimit
gasUsed
timestamp
extraData
mixHash
nonce
hash
transactions[]
uncles[]
If anyone has experience with defining constraints for zk-SNARK circuits and could share some guidance or resources, I would be very grateful. Thank you in advance for your help!

Best regards,
Shreyan
i tried reffering to the circuit of other rollups that are using circom for their circuits for example fluidex but i am not able to understand how they wrote such complex circuit and what exactly is happenning inside the circuits.

Here's my math on this:
WETH reserves on UniSwap were 94.7186209660738
At a price of 1 WETH / 143 FXS on Sushiswap, the output from using all that WETH would be 13544.7627981486000 FXS
Selling that amount of FXS of Uniswap at a price of 1 WETH / 142 FXS would provide a return in WETH of 95.38565351
Gas was 0.0005851026412 ETH for this transaction
There are also .3% transaction fees to account for on Uniswap and Sushiswap

So here's the calculation: 
95.38565351 - (95.38565351 * .003) - 0.0005851026412 - 94.7186209660738 - (94.7186209660738 *.003) = 0.0981357135770 ETH

Now, just for fun, what if we change the transaction fee to 30% for each?

Then the total becomes -56.1647251402709 ETH ... very close to the -55.01936314413639 ETH final calculation spurred on by getAmountsIn.  

I don't know if that last bit is a false equivalency or not, but I've seen it when doing the math on 10-20 or more swaps like this.  In any case, there should have been a gain of nearly .1 ETH on this transaction.  So why is getAmountsIn giving me such a drastically different number?",javascriptethereumblockchainweb3jsuniswap,,Trent Kennelly,"Add a comment

There is some confusion about the format for different blockchains, but at least for main blockchains - it seems to be defined as:

for ETH (or BTC) and

for EVM-compatible coins (like USDC here).
source: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-681
however... BNB doesn't seem to follow that format. I tried the following:
binance:0xba5830175b16e5e48d94c6fa11041ff9ed3bae5a?amount=1.123
bnb:0xba5830175b16e5e48d94c6fa11041ff9ed3bae5a?amount=1.123
binance:0xba5830175b16e5e48d94c6fa11041ff9ed3bae5a?amount=1.123&memo=1234

and:

both Binance and Exodus apps don't understand any of the above (not even eth or btc) - I'd appreciate links to their qr code requirements specs

Trust Wallet doesn't accept a BNB address written like that (funnily enough - amount and memo work flawlessly - same here, docs links would be amazing

metamask (which is Binance smart chain compatible) doesn't understand any of the BNB options - same here


I have honestly spent hours researching this topic and I am simply astonished by the lack of documentation in that regard.
as a bonus, just for the sake of informing others - XRP has its own super complex QR code format and it's available as a package here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ripple-address-codec

Motoko language, console prompted a breaking change on running dfx deploy",10 days ago,10 days ago,"I was following a course tutorial to create a small decentralized bank application using dfinity's internet computer.
the main.mo file is as follows:
import Debug ""mo:base/Debug"";
import Float ""mo:base/Float"";
import Time ""mo:base/Time"";

actor DBank {
  stable var currentValue: Float = 300;
  stable var startTime = Time.now();
  Debug.print(debug_show(currentValue));

  public func topUp(amount: Float){
    currentValue += amount;
    Debug.print(debug_show(currentValue));
  };

  public func withdraw(amount: Float){
    let tempValue: Float = currentValue - amount;
    if(tempValue >= 0){
        currentValue -= amount;
        Debug.print(debug_show(currentValue));
    } else{
      Debug.print(""Withdrawal amount is more than Balance."")
    }
  };

  public query func checkBalance(): async Float{
    return currentValue;
  };

  public func compound() {
    let currentTime = Time.now();
    let timeElapsedNS = currentTime - startTime;
    let timeElapsedSec = timeElapsedNS / 1_000_000_000;
    currentValue := currentValue * (1.01 ** Float.fromInt(timeElapsedSec));
  };

}

The Candid Interface was working until I changed the the data type of currentValue from Nat to float. It showed a warning when i ran dfx deploy on the terminal:
user***@hp:~/ic-projects/dbank$ dfx deploy
Deploying all canisters.
All canisters have already been created.

WARNING!
Candid interface compatibility check failed for canister 'dbank'.
You are making a BREAKING change. Other canisters or frontend clients relying on your canister may stop working.

Method checkBalance: func () -> (float64) query is not a subtype of func () -> (nat) query
Do you want to proceed? yes/No
yes

I do not have the original warning, I tried to recreate it so float64 and nat might be interchanged.
On deployment the Candid UI shows this:
An error happened in Candid canister:

I was thinking whether this could be a problem from Time module but couldn't find much about it, as the module documentation page has been removed.
Looked up the ingress_expiry problem and tried it's solutions:
the local machine's time is correct and in sync with the actual time.
Using wsl1 in vscode, it is the latest version i suppose as running wsl --update shows you have the latest version
The breaking change warning in the question description was orginally prompted for the checkBalance() function but I could not include anything worthwhile.",blockchainmotokodfinity,,Angad Manroy,"PS: The error got resolved. I deleted the canister and redeployed the project using  dfx delete canister --all command and upon restarting it, the ui started working.

My Environment:

Solidity - 0.8.13 (solc-js)
Node v18.13.0
Web3.js v1.2.9
Ganache CLI v6.12.2 (ganache-core: 2.13.2)

The steps to reproduce:

fork mainnet

Run truffle test

truffle test --network development

And it shows the error revert TX Limit Exceeded -- Reason given: TX Limit Exceeded.
I think it should not be the issue from my contract code but from the environment. But I am not able to find any reference from google.
It will be very appreciated if anybody can give me a hint.

It just dont work when I use the function tx[""transaction""][""from""] and I filter the wallet or ca I want on ""WALLET"".
Im using Alchemy methods with ws and I have read the documentation about how to use it, I should be missing something.
const { Alchemy, Network, AlchemySubscription } = require(""alchemy-sdk"")
const {ethers, FixedNumber} = require(""ethers"")
const delay = require('delay')
require(""dotenv"").config()

const ARBI_WS_KEY = process.env.ARBI_WS_KEY

  apiKey: ARBI_WS_KEY, // Replace with your Alchemy API Key
  network: Network.ARB_MAINNET, // Replace with your network

const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings)

// Subscription for Alchemy's minedTransactions API

I have to write a research paper and I have decided to do it on blockchain technology since I have already written a survey paper as my minor, which is based on Blockchain and DDoS Mitigation Strategies.
I have read through various research papers that tackle the same and especially focusing upon the Future Scope section of each to understand what I can work on to come up with a solution but I am not able to get many ideas.
What I need:

A software program that simulates a blockchain network, and allows me to test attacks and/or modify smart contract code. I have tried working out 'blocksim' and 'simblock', one does not run for me, the other will take days for me to try the demo version.

If possible, though asking for something far-fetched, a solution I could work on or atleast a direction in which I can look considering I can code because gaining deep understanding of Blockchain and what and how I can improve in the same is complicated, especially with not much knowledge-base of security and testing which is half as major for this project.


Help of any sorts is really appreciated!

Is this the right way to compute price of token A that have fixed price in amount of B tokens?
function calculatePrice(uint8 decimalsA, uint256 priceForA, uint256 amountOfB) public {
return amountOfB * 10 ** decimalsA / priceForA;

Decimals for both tokens A and B can be equal or one can be higher or lower than the other.
For example
decimalsA = 6;
decimalsB = 18;
// priceForA is price for 1 (human readable) A token which is 0.01 (human readable) B tokens
// so in other words for 1000000 A you need to pay 10000000000000000 B
priceForA = 10000000000000000; 
// this is the amount of B tokens that will be used to buy A tokens
amountOfB = 50000000000000000;

In this example we should get 5000000 as return value so 5A (human readable) tokens.",ethereumblockchainsoliditycryptocurrencycurrency-formatting,Jan 27 at 19:21,,"Generally, there is no reason to calculate human-readable decimals in Solidity code.

Implementation of Transact and wait

tx_hash = contractName.functions.functionName(account.address).transact({""gas"": 100000}))

Nethereum sending ether fail,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75250879/nethereum-sending-ether-fail,0,0,17,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GizGSM75Xlmx5vVvYgx1S5WcrdkXFHtxQbxaTnHdiU=k-s32,Jan 26 at 19:38,145,Angelo Schuler Piletti,https://stackoverflow.com/users/15650422/angelo-schuler-piletti,Nethereum sending ether fail,21 days ago,21 days ago,"Introduction
I'm developing a .NET 6 environment that has an API for transferring ether from one wallet to another wallet. It uses the Nethereum library for that.
Issue
I'm getting the Transaction Hash of the ether transfer. But when I'm trying to see it on Etherscan (see here) it doesn't appear. In addition to that, in my wallet, the value isn't transferred.
Workflow
The controller calls Transfer method, which calls TransferWaitingTxHashAsync method.
public bool Transfer(int ecommerceId, EtherWallet senderWallet, TransferRequestVO transferRequest)
    {
        string transactionHash = null;
        bool thrownError = false;
        try
        {
            transactionHash = _hdWalletManager.TransferWaitingTxHashAsync(senderWallet, transferRequest).Result;
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            thrownError = true;
        }

        if(thrownError || transactionHash == null) 
            return false;
        

        EthereumTransactionReceipt pendingTransactionReceipt = new()
        {
            From = senderWallet.Address,
            To = transferRequest.AddressDestination,
            EcommerceId = ecommerceId,
            TransactionHash = transactionHash,
            Status = EthereumTransactionReceiptAvailableStatus.Pending.Value
        };

        _ethereumTransactionReceiptRepository.Insert(pendingTransactionReceipt);
        bool saveChanges = _ethereumTransactionReceiptRepository.SaveChanges();

        return saveChanges;
    }

As you can see below, I'm doubling both Gas and GasPrice.
The Nonce is being summed to avoid transaction replacement underpriced (changing it on the debugger each time I run).
public Task<string> TransferWaitingTxHashAsync(EtherWallet senderWallet, TransferRequestVO transferRequest)
    {
        NethereumAccount senderAccount = new(senderWallet.PrivateKey);
        Web3 web3 = new(senderAccount, _httpAddress);

        HexBigInteger gasPrice = web3.Eth.GasPrice.SendRequestAsync().Result;
        decimal gasPriceDecimal = Math.Round(gasPrice.ToLong() * 2m);
        gasPriceDecimal = Web3.Convert.FromWei(BigInteger.Parse(gasPriceDecimal.ToString()), UnitConversion.EthUnit.Gwei);

        BigInteger gas = web3.Eth.GetEtherTransferService()
                                 .EstimateGasAsync(transferRequest.AddressDestination,
                                                   transferRequest.EtherAmount)
                                 .Result;

        gas = BigInteger.Add(gas, gas);

        BigInteger nonce = senderAccount.NonceService.GetNextNonceAsync().Result;
        BigInteger nextNonce = nonce + 131;


        return web3.Eth.GetEtherTransferService()
                       .TransferEtherAsync(transferRequest.AddressDestination,
                                           transferRequest.EtherAmount,
                                           gasPriceDecimal,
                                           gas,
                                           nextNonce);
    }


Environment
I'm running it locally using Infura as the provider (https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR-API-KEY) for Goerli network.

So how to clearly identify the type of transfer of a TX I'm parsing: whether it's EITHER SOL transfer, OR a token transfer? As well as the amount.
Will it be by the presense of the field lamports - SOL transfer. Namely, instructions[X].parsed.info[""lamports""] Will be be a reliable way?
On the contrary: how to identify if a TX is a pure ""token transfer"" one? Not the one that may involve ""token transfer"" among other instructions, but is only ""token transfer"" one.
I don't expect any other, more complex types of TX in my list of addresses. If such TX-s happen to occur, I'll filter them out during parsing.",blockchainsolanasolana-transaction-instruction,,Marco C. Stewart,"Add a comment

My plan is as follows.
1-Deploy an exploit contract:

  function setTime(uint _time) public {
    storedTime = tx.origin;

When sending a delegatecall to the setTime function, the third state variable of the calling contract should be set to tx.origin.
2- Call the setFirstTime function of the Preservation contract while passing it the address of the deployed Exploit contract, converted to decimals.
3- Call the setFirstTime function again, this time the called contract is the Exploit contract that will set the third state variable of the calling contract (owner) to tx.origin.
It works just fine when deploying the contracts in Remix VM, but when deploying to Goerli, the timezone1Library variable is effectively changed to the exploit contract address, but the owner variable won't budge. No idea why.",securityblockchainsolidity,,Ali Jouahri,"Add a comment

I can see that they have 03 components [1]:

BNB Beacon Chain - The staking and governance layer of BNB ecosystem.
BNB Smart Chain (BSC) - An EVM compatible blockchain
ZkBNB

But I'm not sure if BNB Beacon Chain supports smart contracts or not? As I can see many types of tokens/assets on that chain [2], but I can't find the token's address, only owner address (who initially issued the token) is available.
If BNB Beacon Chain is available to deploy smart contracts, which are some references/tutorials/demo sources?
Thanks for help!

Hello! I'm trying to write a method that will generate a TRC20 wallet from a mnemonic phrase and also access an existing wallet on the same network. I found a package a package that should help me - wallet.

the phrase used to generate the wallet in the method: 'boost limit you peasant april setup print arrest love festival much consider', and in the method with it the address TZ5kGfid2b7FdP3VaqcFf7PKDC64s7htzB is created, while in the trust wallet with the same phrase I connect to the wallet TY2wEqpxfw6ZK9hXWVat5hKgyrPqg2dfy3.

Does the private blockchain have to follow client-server model when considering BFT?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74946782/does-the-private-blockchain-have-to-follow-client-server-model-when-considering,0,0,27,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp6Rl1FAVbxc7dnlEBATB_PkWJCBTF6sDd5x8oQK=k-s32,"Dec 29, 2022 at 2:44",1,J.L.,https://stackoverflow.com/users/20883129/j-l,Does the private blockchain have to follow client-server model when considering BFT?,1 month ago,1 month ago,"I'm a newbie, currently interested in data security & integrity.
I'm quite new to blockchain and distributed system theories, and suffering from some unclear doubts/questions on the fault-tolerant consensus.
May I ask for your kind advice on my dull thoughts regarding on the blockchain's true objective?
It would be a great help for me to step forward on understading better concept of consensus.
Here's the summary of what I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong)

In a synchronous network model, it is assumed that one can guarantee the message being delivered within a certain amount of time.
In an asynchronous network model, there is no certain guarantee on the message delivery.
In a design perspective, it is easier & more efficient to design a system based on the synchronous model.
Even the quorum size requirement can be reduced - synchronous model needs only f+1 votes while asynchronous model needs 2f+1 votes on the consensus.
(This is because that the synchronous model can eliminate the possiblity of message dropout (up to f), while the async model needs to consider both message dropout & possibly malicious messages.)
But in a distributed system based on multiple nodes, it is normally impossible to guarantee the message delivery since there is no central manager who can monitor all nodes whether each receives the message or not.
That is why most of the blockchain-oriented distributed ledgers (non-currency) are based on the asynchronous consensus schemes such as PBFT (Castro, Liskov 99).

In a private blockchain scenario, I believe that the main & final purpose of the consensus is to let all nodes hold a chain of blocks, where each block has a certain amount of agreements (i.e. more than f signatures).
So, based on the facts above, I got curious whether the fault-tolerance model only stands for the standard ""client-server"" environment.
What happens if we give up the client-server model, and let the client supersede peers' broadcast communications? (For a scenario where the client has enough computation power but is just short on storage, so it wants to manage multiple (but few, e.g. 3) replicas to store data via transactions)
To be more specific with a simple example (an authenticated environment with PKI):
Each replica only performs a ""block creation (+signing)"" and ""block finalization (verifying signatures)"" logic, and there may exist some malicious replicas (up to f) which try to spread different outputs, which is not originated from the client's transaction.
Let the client (a ""data owner/manager"" would be a more suitable term now...) visit all replicas, and it handles each replica as below:

Enforce that all replicas work as a synchronized state machine; assure all 3 replicas are synced up (check the latest block of each, and supplement the lagged ones)

Sets a callback (with a timeout) for each replica to guarantee the message delivery

Send a transaction to all replicas, and receive the block (with a signature) generated from the corresponding transaction (assume that the block contains only one transaction)

If more than f signatures (from replicas) for the same block message are collected, deliver the collected signatures to all replicas and order them to finalize the block.


If we do as above, instead of replicas making consensus on their own (i.e. no view-changes), can we still say that the system suffices a BFT model?
It seems that byzantine replicas cannot breach safety, since the client (and honest replicas) will only order/accept block finalization when the block comes with more than f signatures.
The concern is the liveness - can we say that the liveness still holds, since the system can continue (not a client-server model anymore, but the ""system"" goes on) because the client will ignore the faulty replica response and order honest replicas to finalize?
This curiosity is just stuck in my head, and it's blocking me from clearly understanding why the private blockchain systems need asynchronous consensus process among peers themselves.
(since they already trust the client transactions, and participants are designated by PKI & signatures)
Could anyone be kind and inform that whether my dominant-client example can still suffice the BFT, or something would go wrong?

Here is my code which I am follow :-
export const transferOnChainWalletPOZBalance = async (
  pozPouchFundWallet: string,
  amountValue: number,
  userWallet: string,
  connector: any,
) => {
  return new Promise<string>(async (resolve, reject) => {
    const POZ_TOKEN = await fetchItemFromStorage('POZ_TOKEN');
    const WEB3_URL = await fetchItemFromStorage('WEB3_URL');
    const Web3js = new Web3(WEB3_URL as string);
    let toAddress = pozPouchFundWallet; // end address to transfer amount
    let decimals = BigNumber(18);
    let amount1 = new BigNumber(amountValue);
    let value = amount1.times(new BigNumber(10).pow(decimals));
    let contract = new Web3js.eth.Contract(POZ_ABI, POZ_TOKEN!);
    try {
      let dataa = await contract.methods
        .approve(toAddress, value.toString())
        .encodeABI();
      let txObj = {
        // gas: Web3js.utils.toHex(100000),
        // value: value,
        data: Web3js.utils.toHex(dataa),
        from: userWallet,
        to: POZ_TOKEN, // Contractor token address
      };
      try {
        const transactionHash = await connector
          .sendTransaction(txObj)
          .catch((_err: any) => {
            Toast.show({
              autoHide: true,
              text1: t('topUpPoz.transactionFailed'),
              type: 'error',
            });
          });
        console.log('approve transactionHash is =', transactionHash);
        resolve(transactionHash);
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('approve the connector error is = ', error);
        reject(error);
      }
    } catch (err) {

The contract gets deployed but the error continues and I should be able to create new projects for Crowdfunding Dapp but because of this error the projects do not get loaded.",reactjsblockchainsolidityweb3js,"Dec 20, 2022 at 20:19",TylerH,"Will need more context here, when exactly does the error occur? When you call a specific function? When you build the frontend?  Also, I see that you're deploying on localhost and not a testnet, have you configured your metamask wallet for your local hardhat node? Is metamask installed?

From what I've observed, the only ""equivalent"" that exists out there are exercises that ask someone to identify a vulnerability / weakness in a smart contract or to create code capable of exploiting a given contract.
However, I'm looking for something that more closely resembles the problems classically created for other programming languages like, ""Write a python/C++ program to check whether the given number is even or not"" (won't bother providing answer for brevity's sake). I'm also wondering whether creating a functional equivalent for solidity is even practical (or possible).
I'm not knowledgeable enough about the field of programming to know if there are any other languages that are used in the same way Solidity is. What I mean is that solidity isn't like other programming languages that are constructed for general purposes. For example, that example programming problem I gave could not be retrofitted to ask, ""Write a solidity program to check whether the given number is even or not"" (if you disagree, however, please correct me on this, because that would profoundly change the trajectory of my current research).
I stated this assumption to help provide context for why I'm making this request in the first place.
I tried scouring the internet for ""solidity problem sets"" and each time I thought I found a potential solution, I only came across exercises that require you to find a vulnerability / exploit or CTF-based challenges, which essentially address the same issue. Frankly, I haven't even seen another conversation online where someone is either looking for or making this same request. If I'm wrong on that, please feel free to correct me.",ethereumblockchainsolidity,,Librehash,"There are different sites that allows to have a specific set of issues to solve in Solidity or in others programming language.

InsufficientBalanceException: Insufficient spendable states identified for $requiredAmount. 

when i tried to execute a transaction by transferring  ""100""  tokens from one Account(sender) to  Account (receiver). But i didn't issue any tokens to the sender Account.
I understand that if we tried to transfer the tokens when there is no tokens available in vault to transfer it was throwing this exception.
The exception is fine (as per corda it will throw InsufficientBalanceException when They're not enough tokens in the vault to transfer,
**but I want to understand when its throwing this exception the execution of transaction is taking more time 10 seconds(aproxx) than usual. if we have sufficient tokens to transfer its taking only 800 ms. **
What are the reasons , why corda is taking more time to execute a transaction when its throwing this exception: InsufficientBalanceException.
Thanks in Advance.
Test Scenario that i have tried:

I have not issued the tokens to Account(sender) but i tried to execute a transaction which is transferring the 100 tokens from one Account (sender) to another Account(receiver). Iam getting the CordaRuntimeException:

InsufficientBalanceException: Insufficient spendable states identified for $requiredAmount. 

by throwing this exception its completing the execution of the transaction Flow. But its taking more time approximately 10 Seconds than an successful transaction (means a successful transaction by transferring the tokens). For successful transaction it is taking only 1 Sec.
but I want to understand when its throwing this exception the transaction taking more time (10 seconds) to complete. What are the reasons , why corda is taking more time to execute a transaction when its throwing this exception: InsufficientBalanceException.",blockchaincorda,"Dec 16, 2022 at 4:30",,"Add a comment

The grid can use any one of the backends either Splinter or Sawtooth.
In the case of Grid on Splinter; Splinter, in turn, is built on a sawtooth-saber (implements an on-chain smart contract that is executed in a WebAssembly virtual machine.)
And sawtooth supports various programming language SDK like

sawtooth-sdk-java
sawtooth-sdk-go
sawtooth-sdk-python
sawtooth-sdk-rust

I have also seen examples of Grid-Product, Pike,  which is written in Rust.

Does this mean I can write an on-chain smart contract in like say java, and deploy that on a Splinter network/circuit?
can I write a similar Grid-Product (smart-contract) in Java and deploy that in place of Grid-Product (which is now in Rust)
Can I replace the Pike as the RBAC framework with another implementation written in Java on a splinter.?
Or does question 3 not even worth it doing on splinter ( or does NOT make sense), but instead I use sawtooth directly as the backend instead of Splinter?
if I can so write in Java, how do I compile into Wasm-compatible scar/jar/or-some-compatible-packaging ? Is there a reference implementation or working example that I can read?",blockchainhyperledgerhyperledger-sawtooth,"Dec 8, 2022 at 14:34",providerZ,"Add a comment

I've created several mocked tokens that are used during the test process (here is an example of one of them):
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol"";

contract Dai is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20(""Dai Stablecoin"", ""DAI"") {}

    function faucet(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}

What I'm trying to do? I'm trying to mint tokens before each test execution.
Here is my test:
const expectRevert = require('@openzeppelin/test-helpers/src/expectRevert');

const Dai = artifacts.require('mocks/Dai.sol');
const Bat = artifacts.require('mocks/Bat.sol');
const Rep = artifacts.require('mocks/Rep.sol');
const Zrx = artifacts.require('mocks/Zrx.sol');
const Dex = artifacts.require('Dex.sol');

  let dai, bat, rep, zrx, dex;

  const [trader1, trader2] = [accounts[1], accounts[2]];
  const [DAI, BAT, REP, ZRX] = ['DAI', 'BAT', 'REP', 'ZRX'].map((ticker) =>
    web3.utils.fromAscii(ticker)
  );

  beforeEach(async () => {
    tokenList = await Promise.all([Dai.new(), Bat.new(), Rep.new(), Zrx.new()]);
    [dai, bat, rep, zrx] = tokenList;

    dex = await Dex.new();

    await Promise.all([
      dex.addToken(DAI, dai.address),
      dex.addToken(BAT, bat.address),
      dex.addToken(REP, rep.address),
      dex.addToken(ZRX, zrx.address),
    ]);

    const amount = web3.utils.toWei('1000');
    const seedTokenBalance = async (token, trader) => {
      await token.faucet(trader, amount);
      await token.approve(dex.address, amount, {
        from: trader,
      });
    };

    await Promise.all(
      tokenList.map((token) => seedTokenBalance(token, trader1))
    );
    await Promise.all(
      tokenList.map((token) => seedTokenBalance(token, trader2))
    );
  });

  describe('deposit', () => {
    it('should deposit token', async () => {
      const amount = web3.utils.toWei('100');

      await dex.deposit(amount, DAI, {
        from: trader1,
      });

      const balance = await dex.traderBalances(trader1, DAI);

      assert(balance.toString() === amount);
    });

    it('should NOT deposit tokens if token does not exist', async () => {

        ),
        'Token does not exist.'
      );
    });
  });
});

My test is constantly failing on that part of code:
await token.approve(dex.address, amount, {
        from: trader,
      });

with the following error:

Error: Returned error: VM Exception while processing transaction: the tx doesn't have the correct nonce. account has nonce of: 1 tx has nonce of: 0 (vm hf=london -> block -> tx) -- Reason given: Custom error (could not decode).

How can I fix this nonce inconsistency? Can anybody explain me the meaning of this error?

                if the admin sign cert expired too, you need to fetch the channel config and replace the old expired in it with the new certs.

                yes you are right, chaincode upgrade is channel operation and for that we need update channel config also. Replacing certs only make transactions working.

Any guidance will be helpful and appreciated. Thanks!",blockchainweb3jsdecentralized-applications,,Coding_templar,"MoodContract is obviously not yet initialized at the point in time when you try to execute that promise. You need to do some basic debugging before posting your questions here. I mean, this one didn't even need any debug, it only required you to infer a rather obvious conclusion out of the error message that you've received.

                I am not too good with JavaScript or Solidity at this point of time. Knew c++ and python. So I have no idea what you exactly mean. As far as I understand, I did iniitialize it later at line 64=>       MoodContract = new ethers.Contract(MoodContractAddress, MoodContractABI, signer);  Please correct me if this is not the right way or should I add something to it.

                Have you verified that the line where you initialize it is executed before the line where you use it? Print it right before you use it, and make sure that you don't get undefined printed.

The problem is that even if I connected the Metamask to the dapp, I cannot get its balance. But, the most interesting part, I cannot see the address which is connected. I used moralis and ethers in the dapp. This is the code for balance:
const getBalance = async () => {
    const provider = await connectBlockchain()
    const balance = await provider.getBalance(STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS)
    const balanceInEth = ethers.utils.formatEther(balance)
    const finalBalance = (+balanceInEth).toFixed(4)
    setWalletBalance(finalBalance)
  }

 useEffect(() => {
    getBalance()
  }, [getBalance])

In this code account returns null
const { account } = useMoralis()
  console.log(account)

Thanks in advance",blockchainsmartcontractsethers.jsmoralis,,Recep Çankaya,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                You should log account from useMoralis in a useEffect. You can use enableWeb3() from useMoralis to connect your MetaMask account - this will then populate the account state. Also you can call getBalance() in the account useEffect if account is valid e.g. if (account) getBalance().

                I did what you said and it seems I cannot connect the contract in a right way, but it is strange that my wallet is connected to the dapp. What might be the reason? Should i check contract address or abi?

This code convert dataurl (format for nft saved in db) to image

In first try, i successfully created nft with metadata, but now using a min website seems to be impossible, the time that it worked the image was stored in a directory and not in a dataurl format.
Hope someone can help,

Now, I want to deploy my project on Binance blockchain, so ofcourse I do not want to put gas fee when sync method call, What I want is to call sync method after every swap by the user.
I have put sync method in token transfer method but uniswap is not allowing me to do it.
Here is my code:
    function _transfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount, uint256 amount2) internal override {

//The method used to get the change in price after swap and for maintain the price of liquidity.
//Sync method is called in this method and it will update the balance of liquidity.
        updatePairBalance();

However I am a little confused how this works. If a university gives a verifiable degree to student X, sure the student can share the hashID or degree ID with a potential employer. But what stops someone from pretending to be the university and issuing an identical degree with a different hash ID, which can be shared with a potential employer. In other words, what part of the degree establishes the ""actual"" university signed this degree, and not someone pretending to be the university?
I am new to blockchain so I am still looking to understand the basics. Each approach i have explored only matches the hash with the issuer key. The problem is even if I am ""pretending to be the university"", my hash will match with my key.

The blockchain is a list of of dictionaries, which contain transactions stored in a string (in the a format that can be extracted as a dictionary later).
The following is one of many dictionaries in the blockchain list().
Where you see 'Block transactions', each entry with sender address, recipient address, and amount are strings.
{'index': 1, 'timestamp': '', 'data':{'Block transactions':
[""{'sender_address': 'a', 'recipient_address': 'b', 'amount': 1}"",

}, 'proof': 1, 'previous_hash': '0'}
What I'm trying to do is loop through the blockchain and extract transactions and sum them to calculate the balance on a user's wallet. To do this I've got two loops (one inside the other). The first one does the following:

Extracts the block dict() from the blockchain list()

Then extracts the transaction dict() from the extracted block

Removes the unnecessary characters from the transaction strings

Then turns the transaction strings stored in a dict()


The second loop does the following:

Loop through each transaction adding or subtracting the value from an overall wallet balance.

Here errors.PendingRequestsOnReconnectingError() will return error : ""provider started to reconnect before response got received.
As i am using public RPC, it will break websocket connection after some random period of time(i dont know why) even if we have set keepAlive to true.
I am not getting use case of condition
if (this.responseQueue.size > 0)

Like why its checking for responsequeue every time on reconnect.
i tried to comment out ""request.callback(errors.PendingRequestsOnReconnectingError());"" and it was working proper i was getting receipt of tx, even if tx is in pending state on reconnect.i dont know how as ""_this.responseQueue.delete(key)"" will delete key.
here is full function of reconnect.
WebsocketProvider.prototype.reconnect = function () {
    var _this = this;
    this.reconnecting = true;
    if (this.responseQueue.size > 0) {
        this.responseQueue.forEach(function (request, key) {
            request.callback(errors.PendingRequestsOnReconnectingError());
            _this.responseQueue.delete(key);
        });
    }
    if (!this.reconnectOptions.maxAttempts ||
        this.reconnectAttempts < this.reconnectOptions.maxAttempts) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            _this.reconnectAttempts++;
            _this._removeSocketListeners();
            _this.emit(_this.RECONNECT, _this.reconnectAttempts);
            _this.connect();
        }, this.reconnectOptions.delay);
        return;
    }
    this.emit(this.ERROR, errors.MaxAttemptsReachedOnReconnectingError());
    this.reconnecting = false;

            _this.requestQueue.delete(key);
        });
    }
};

I dont want to handle error, i just want to know use-case of the condition.I mean its totally RPC provider-side issue as they are breaking websocket connection. and i know that dedicated RPC-node
may solve or reduce this type of errors.",javascriptwebsocketblockchainweb3js,,unknown_user,"Add a comment

This is the code where I create the token (and send it to an account):
createToken(BigInt(supply), nume, simbol, BigInt(decimals))
       .catch(error => {

      const my_token = await myToken.deploy(supply, tokenName, symbol, decimals);
      console.log(""Contract deployed to address:"", my_token.address);
      await my_token.transfer(address, supply)
      console.log(""sent to "" + address)
    
      res.send(my_token.address)
    
      listToken(address, tokenName, symbol, decimals).catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
      });
    }

And this is the function generated by a .ts file for listing it:

        var _a, immutables, state, TokenA, TokenB, poolExample;

Then

How to get all smart contracts on the eth blockchain plus their number of occurrences in transactions?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74267659/how-to-get-all-smart-contracts-on-the-eth-blockchain-plus-their-number-of-occurr,0,0,21,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pe3i2PzNeBc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcK4ahfhjFX5uqKey5OnFqv_buvYw/photo.jpg?sz=32,"Oct 31, 2022 at 18:26",348,user101893,https://stackoverflow.com/users/15673860/user101893,How to get all smart contracts on the eth blockchain plus their number of occurrences in transactions?,3 months ago,3 months ago,"So my goal is pretty much outlined in the title, but here are a few additional thoughts.
Why do I want to do this?
I would like to come up with a ranking of the most used contracts throughout all blockchain history from block 0. Computational expense is not a primary concern here. Ranking the contracts by their activity will then just be an initial information for which are the top contracts that are worth being investigated in more detail
My understanding of the process:
As far as I understand, a contract address doesnt appear in the transactions, it rather appears encoded in the topics array in the logs of block transactions. Thus, I cannot simply monitor the occurrence of transaction addresses. Instead I (i) firstly need to run a first extract to determine all transactions where a new contract was deployed (and I dont know the name of this event, can anybody help on that?) and (ii) secondly, once I have the entire list of deployed contracts, I need to inversely map transactions log data (via topics field?) to the contract data for each tx that ever appeared. The problem is, due to hashing, the topics field is not invertible, right? Probably, I would first need all ABIs for all contracts, in order to create hashes of all their events. These can then be mapped to the topics that occur in the transaction logs. Counting the occurrences of topics associated to events of a certain contract would then be a measure of the usage of the contract, right?
Is there any shortcut to this process? Especially the step with downloading all the ABIs seems nasty. Maybe, I am also totally off in my understanding, or there is a much better way to get contract activity?

When working on testnet I am finding some times it gives me zero numbers and not a random one. This behaviour is random. Subscription is funded and smart contract added as a comsumer.
May this happen on mainnet also?
On most cases this kind of errors are only testnet timeouts, or other stuff related to slower infrastructure.
I wish to implement something to prevent shipping the NFT when zeroes are recevied:
I tried to put assert(randomNumber!=[zero]); but I got some errors, as gas stimation functions on wallets can ensure this, so they set highest fee.
Any suggestions to keep this secured?
This is the main testnet smart contract bsc address https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x74623BaE2c3AcC39Db224c236229dc4d5aD1F64d#code
is there any warranty the request random number operation finishes succesfully, or how can I take care of it on my code?

To me looks like you want to record votes on chain, but all the votes come from the same account (owner). Is that right? Do you really need to emit 1 event for each vote received, if all the votes come from the same account? Cannot you just publish a combined version of the votes (i.e. # of votes per artist), and emit an Event with the total # of votes received by artist? That would be more scalable IMHO

                Why isn't websocket what you want?  Will it need to receive notifications while the app is not running? If so you won't be able to accomplish this with only react-native. You'll likely need a server running that can listen for your subscriptions and dispatch push notifications.  If the use case is ""only while the app is open"" then you could listen to blockchain.com's websocket API on your client (react-native app).

I'm implementing an Address Balance tracking service using Blockchain.com's Websockets. I'm following this API Docs page:

https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/api/api_websocket

I managed to find a Bitcoin address that does a lot of transactions each day, which is perfect for Address Balance tracking:

bc1qw8wrek2m7nlqldll66ajnwr9mh64syvkt67zlu
https://mempool.space/address/bc1qw8wrek2m7nlqldll66ajnwr9mh64syvkt67zlu

So I subscribed to that address with the method described in the API Docs:
{
  ""op"": ""addr_sub"",
  ""addr"": ""bc1qw8wrek2m7nlqldll66ajnwr9mh64syvkt67zlu""
}

But their Websocket is not notifying me each time a new transaction is executed.
Code explanation
This is my working code, you just need to install websockets ('ws' library) and run it in a typescript environment. It's straightforward: I just have an init() function that creates the WebSocket and tells the Websocket what to do on ""open"", ""close"", ""message"", ""data"" and ""error"", which is basically just logging what data is received. Once that part's done, I subscribe to the address mentioned above and wait for a response. I also do a ping every 5 seconds to get a simple heartbeat.
import * as ws from 'ws';

export class BlockchainDotCom {
  /**
   * The Websocket instance
   * @type {ws.WebSocket}
   * @private
   */
  private websocket: ws.WebSocket;

  /**
   * Counter for how many msgs were received.
   * @type {number}
   */
  static msgCounter = 0;

  /**
   * Init the websocket
   * @return {Promise<void>}
   */
  async init(): Promise<void> {
    this.websocket = await this.createWebsocket();
    this.setOnMessage();
    this.setOnData();
    this.setOnError();
    await sleep(1000);
    await this.subscribeToAddress('bc1qw8wrek2m7nlqldll66ajnwr9mh64syvkt67zlu');
  }

  /**
   * Pings the websocket for the latest block.
   */
  ping(): void {
    this.websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ op: 'ping_block' }));
  }

  /**
   * Subscribe to address, receiving notifications of new txs.
   * @TODO Doesn't work
   * @param {string} address
   * @return {Promise<void>}
   */
  async subscribeToAddress(address: string): Promise<void> {
    this.websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ op: 'addr_sub', addr: address }));
    console.log(`Subscribed to address ` + address);
  }

  /**
   * Creates a WebSocket object with instructions on opening the socket, receiving messages and closing the socket.
   * @return {Promise<WebSocket>}
   */
  private async createWebsocket(): Promise<WebSocket> {
    const websocket = new ws.WebSocket('wss://ws.blockchain.info/inv');

    // What to do when the Websocket opens
    websocket.on('open', () => {
      console.log('Blockchain.com Websocket open');
    });

    // If we don't wait, the websocket won't be open yet and the this.ping() Interval will throw an error.
    await sleep(2000);
    const interval = setInterval(() => this.ping(), 5000);

    // What to do when the Websocket closes
    websocket.on('close', async () => {
      console.log('Blockchain.com Websocket closed');
      clearInterval(interval);
      websocket.terminate();
      await sleep(10000);
      return this.createWebsocket(); // Auto restart if it closes
    });
    return websocket;
  }

  /**
   * Tells the Websocket what should happen in the ""message"" event.

  private setOnMessage(): void {
    this.websocket.on('message', (data) => {
      let msg = data.toString();
      const parsedData = JSON.parse(msg);
      if (parsedData['op'] === 'block') {
        msg = `   Current Block Index: ${parsedData['x']['blockIndex']}`;
      }
      if (parsedData['op'] === 'utx') {
        msg = `   New Transaction Detected: ${parsedData}`;
      }
      console.log(`Msg #${BlockchainDotCom.msgCounter++}: ${getDate()}`);
      console.log(msg);
    });
  }

  /**
   * Tells the Websocket what should happen in the ""data"" event.

      }
      console.log(`Msg #${BlockchainDotCom.msgCounter++}: ${getDate()}`);
      console.log(msg);
    });
  }

  /**

      if (data) {
        console.log(data);

Observations
This is a sample Output. You can see that the Block Index has increased, so a new block has been mined. But the transactions in that block weren't reported. I've let this program run for hours, but all that was ever logged is the ping msg.
   Current Block Index: 759207
Msg #85: 18-9-2022   12:47:29
   Current Block Index: 759207
Msg #86: 18-9-2022   12:47:34
   Current Block Index: 759207
Msg #87: 18-9-2022   12:47:39
   Current Block Index: 759207
Msg #88: 18-9-2022   12:47:44
   Current Block Index: 759207
Msg #89: 18-9-2022   12:47:49
   Current Block Index: 759207
Msg #90: 18-9-2022   12:47:55
   Current Block Index: 759207
Msg #91: 18-9-2022   12:47:59
   Current Block Index: 759209
Msg #92: 18-9-2022   12:48:05
   Current Block Index: 759209
Msg #93: 18-9-2022   12:48:10
   Current Block Index: 759209
Msg #94: 18-9-2022   12:48:15
   Current Block Index: 759209
Msg #95: 18-9-2022   12:48:20
   Current Block Index: 759209
Msg #96: 18-9-2022   12:48:25
   Current Block Index: 759209
Msg #97: 18-9-2022   12:48:30
   Current Block Index: 759209
Msg #98: 18-9-2022   12:48:35
   Current Block Index: 759209

But new address transactions, there's no response. It also doesn't send an error.
Oddly enough when I subscribe to receiving notifications of new blocks, then it does notify me:
{
  ""op"": ""blocks_sub""
}

Any ideas on what's going wrong? Have other people got it working?",typescriptwebsocketblockchain,"Oct 18, 2022 at 12:47",,"Add a comment

Transaction not updating data in smart contract web3.py,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74025419/transaction-not-updating-data-in-smart-contract-web3-py,0,0,29,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc74ba07cc399ac1ead879fc788dd1c1?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Oct 11, 2022 at 8:49",601,revmatcher,https://stackoverflow.com/users/13530621/revmatcher,Transaction not updating data in smart contract web3.py,4 months ago,4 months ago,"I have a smart contract written in Solidity that stores a blacklist of strings. I have written methods to add strings to the blacklist as well as check if a particular string is present in the blacklist. These methods are called addBlacklist() and retrieveBlacklist() respectively. I've deployed the smart contract on a Web3 API project on Infura and passed its URL, my metamask wallet account number, and the account's private key to my Web3 code in Python.
The current problem that I'm facing is that transactions to the smart contract are not making any changes to the contract and not updating the blacklist. This is evident from the below code where, after retrieval of the string '127.0.0.212' after adding it to the blacklist yields false.
ipblacklist_sol = w3.eth.contract(abi=abi, address=""0xB0CA9272BF4a2C68ec3702d14C1bdC5A4Ee6E9af"")
add_blacklist = ipblacklist_sol.functions.addBlacklist('127.0.0.212').buildTransaction(
    {""gasPrice"": w3.eth.gas_price, ""chainId"": chain_id, ""from"": my_address, ""nonce"": nonce + 3}
)
sign_add_blacklist = w3.eth.account.signTransaction(add_blacklist, private_key=private_key)
tx_add_blacklist_hash = w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(sign_add_blacklist.rawTransaction)
# tx_add_blacklist_receipt = w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_add_blacklist_hash)

print(ipblacklist_sol.functions.retrieveBlacklist('127.0.0.212').call())

I commented out the receipt line because that seemed to time out the operation after 120 seconds. The image given below is the result I get. It says that the IP is not added to the blacklist.

But if I create a new contract each time right above this piece of code, and immediately pass the new contract's address to the above code, then the IP address is added to the blacklist.
IPBlacklist = w3.eth.contract(abi=abi, bytecode=bytecode)
nonce = w3.eth.getTransactionCount(my_address)
# set up transaction from constructor which executes when firstly
transaction = IPBlacklist.constructor().buildTransaction(
    {""gasPrice"": w3.eth.gas_price, ""chainId"": chain_id, ""from"": my_address, ""nonce"": nonce}
)
signed_tx = w3.eth.account.signTransaction(transaction, private_key=private_key)
tx_hash = w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_tx.rawTransaction)
tx_receipt = w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)


ipblacklist_sol = w3.eth.contract(abi=abi, address=tx_receipt.contractAddress)
add_blacklist = ipblacklist_sol.functions.addBlacklist('127.0.0.212').buildTransaction(
    {""gasPrice"": w3.eth.gas_price, ""chainId"": chain_id, ""from"": my_address, ""nonce"": nonce + 3}
)
sign_add_blacklist = w3.eth.account.signTransaction(add_blacklist, private_key=private_key)
tx_add_blacklist_hash = w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(sign_add_blacklist.rawTransaction)
tx_add_blacklist_receipt = w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_add_blacklist_hash)

print(ipblacklist_sol.functions.retrieveBlacklist('127.0.0.212').call())

This seems to work, but it creates a new contract each time, which is obviously not what I want. In the first piece of code that I've given here, I passed an existing contract's address in place of the tx_recipt.contractAddress to try and update data on the existing contract.

I'm using rainbowkit wallet which offers various wallet options such as walletconnect and coinbase.
My question is, if I'm connected via metamask then my web3 instance can use window.ethereum as provider.
But if I'm connected to other wallets like walletconnect or coinbase, can I still go with window.ethereum as provider?
i.e. let web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
if not, for other wallets where can I get its provider? is there an option to grab currently connected provider using wagmi?
i am also using
    const { data: signer } = useSigner();
    const provider = useProvider();

what i tried doing is instead of this : 

  const web3 = new Web3(Web3.givenProvider);

 I was trying this below :

 const web3 = new Web3((signer?.provider).provider);



this throws error like :

can someone help me with this issue ?

                you have to print() inside function deploy_simple_storage because account is local variable and it doesn't exists outside function. Besides you try to print it before it will execute deploy_simple_storage(). Other problem is: you forgot s in words accounts in accounts.load(...)

Toughly speaking, I am dealing with the two token SWAP-based use case rather than simple, essential one like mint/transfer.
Having spent a lot of time looking different repos and a few API docs, I only find only the repo Oyster Swap (rather than Swap-UI or Gfx-swap)  is based on the complete, fine-grained Swap details of Solana. However, not being expert in Blockchain protocol design, I am concerned about how to selectively reduce this kind of complexity to only the requirement of just a fixed rate between two specific tokens. So basically it is for building the swap between 1 customized token pegged as being equal to (for example) 5 SOL. It is the just experimental demo for this specific exchange/swap use-case.
As I couldn't have unlimited time to pick up Anchor and Rust as fast as it is wanted, I have to also accept to build the swap logics based on the simple pool on Typescript.
After studying the models/ directory inside in src/, I have to say that rather than chasing all details of the Swap protocols, what parameters or implementation parts can be omitted to just be enough for the simpler and more specific use case aforementioned:

The pool is still mandatory for building the d-exchange place for the swap, but I still have a bit of doubt about whether having a constant specific rate really needs the implementation of DEX? Or somehow transfer of a pegged token valued with that multiplier can be sufficient for implementation? Without a DEX, I think it still need a program id of where it does such transfer right?

In the instruction fn for initializeSwap(), it has a curveType parameter, so since this is a fixed exchange rate, how can this parameter be skipped?

Also, it has concepts of feeDenominator and feeNUmerator, what are these meant for my case to be omitted?

In deposit/withdraw instructions, does maximumTokenA/B mean the maximum allowances of token A/B or am I wrong in that?


This can be a last question, but the purpose for my tokens swap case, is just perform the swap instruction between two tokens (definitely I don't market token listing) with sufficient yet as simple as possible amount of parameters.

    ""name"": ""First Last"",
    ""email"": ""xxx@gmail.com"",
    ""gender"": ""male"",
    ""status"": ""inactive""
  },
...

And I'm attempting to populate the response into a struct list variable (users) using Chainlink any API.
Please find below the contract code :
    pragma solidity ^0.8.7;
    import '@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/ChainlinkClient.sol';
    import '@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/ConfirmedOwner.sol';

      uint256 status;
    }

    event GetUsersData(bytes32 indexed requestId, string jsonData);


    /**

        jobId = '7d80a6386ef543a3abb52817f6707e3b';
        fee = (1 * LINK_DIVISIBILITY) / 10; // 0,1 * 10**18 (Varies by network and job)
    }

    function getUser() public returns (bytes32 requestId){
        Chainlink.Request memory req = buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.fulfill.selector);

        // Set the URL to perform the GET request on
        req.add('get', 'https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/users');
        req.add('path', '$');

    }

    }

How do I add my json object to a struct?
Questions :
1 - Which jsonpath expression to use to retrieve the full json response of the api ? I tried req.add('path', '$') and req.add('path', '*'), but both didn't return the json.
2 - Once the full json is retrieved and stored in jsonData variable, how to parse it and insert the result in ""User[] public users"" variable ?",structblockchainsoliditychainlinkchainlink-keepers,"Oct 4, 2022 at 1:31",Patrick Collins,"What's the error you're getting?

                Hi @PatrickCollins, thanks for your feedback, i updated the post and added the questions. I'm not getting any error, but I'm not able to retrieve the full json response using jsonpath expression.

                That would be a lot of gas... You'd have to convert the data from a json object to a bytes object and then convert it from bytes into your struct... I think a better way would be to use a multi-variable response with just the exact data that you want. docs.chain.link/docs/any-api/get-request/examples/…

                And if you really want all the data, you could use multi-variable response to unpack the data into your struct (again, I don't recommend this as it'll cost a lot of gas) docs.chain.link/docs/any-api/get-request/examples/…

One thing I noticed about the article is that, the nodes in which the writer created does not really connect into each other. after a node mines a block, the node should broadcast the new chain to another node in the network, whereas in the article, there's no mention of that, and hence if i were to create multiple nodes, the chain in each node would be different
My question is, if one were to implement broadcasting node in this code, how would they write it?
Thanks in advance!

My idea was to add the Royalty functionality to the Escrow contract to disperse 5% of fees back to the address of choice with the code below. The royalty code below was used for an ERC1155 build, but I am trying to reuse it for the Escrow implementation.
 /** @dev EIP2981 royalties implementation. */

// Maintain flexibility to modify royalties recipient (could also add basis points).
function _setRoyalties(address newRecipient) internal {
    require(
        newRecipient != address(0),
        ""Royalties: new recipient is the zero address""
    );
    _recipient = newRecipient;
}

function setRoyalties(address newRecipient) external onlyOwner {
    _setRoyalties(newRecipient);
}

// EIP2981 standard royalties return.
function royaltyInfo(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _salePrice)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (address receiver, uint256 royaltyAmount)
{
    return (_recipient, (_salePrice * 1000) / 10000);
}

I receive this error from RemixeIDE

                @1m2n3 Welcome to SO. Smart contracts (SC) live on the blockchain. They are not aware of the existence of any HTML element. So, you can't read the contents of any HTML element using your SC. Perhaps, you mean you are trying to read the contents of HTML elements on the frontend and pass those values to calls to the functions of the SC. In that case, you should be using regular JavaScript to read the contents of the element and interact with the SC using a library like web3.js or ether.js  Unless you mean something else, in which case you should elaborate a bit more on your question

Should I input the multiple events on one listener or create one listener to each event?
as far as I've tested, one listener to each event makes multiple eth_logs calls, which makes sense since they are listening to multiple topics, but one listener to multiple topics makes one call and is triggered whenever they occour.
I just want to know if multiple listeners makes some huge impact on the cost or doesn't make any significant difference, the main pro that I've noticed, is that I can make multiple handlers to each event separately which is handy but I'm concerned on the impact of this.
examples:
const event1 = ""event1"";
const event2 = ""event2"";
const topics = [[event1, event2]];
const address = ""address"";
const arrayEvents = [event1, event2];

provider.on({ address, topics }, handler);
// vs
arrayEvents.forEach((event) => {
  provider.on({ address, event }, handler);

Do not receive confirmation from the user when making a transaction in Phantom Wallet,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73621733/do-not-receive-confirmation-from-the-user-when-making-a-transaction-in-phantom-w,0,0,66,https://i.stack.imgur.com/ARhMw.jpg?s=32&g=1,"Sep 6, 2022 at 12:02",391,Arman,https://stackoverflow.com/users/12365311/arman,Do not receive confirmation from the user when making a transaction in Phantom Wallet,5 months ago,5 months ago,"I am creating a game on the blockchain platform and I am doing the front part using reactjs and for this purpose I am using libraries related to SOLANA and Phantom Wallet. The problem I am facing is that Phantom Wallet asks for confirmation from the user for every transaction that is made. For example, in the game, for each action that the user performs, a message confirming the transaction is displayed. How can this be done without receiving confirmation from the user?
For example, the code that runs to create a game is as follows:

    program.methods
          .setupGame()
          .accounts({
            game: gamePDA,
            authority: wallet.publicKey,

                As far as I know it is not possible, it can lead the user to lose all the funds in dapps that have bad intentions. You can recommend for your users that trust in your app to enable the auto approve in the advanced settings. Or if your app design allows, you can use the provider.signAllTransactions(),

Locally the chaincode works well but I need to deploy it using the AWS Managed Blockchain.
Bounday 1. The AWS docummentation says:

Dependencies on other versions of fabric-shim or other library
packages require that you bundle them with your chaincode because peer
nodes do not have internet access to the NPM repository.
Managed Blockchain doesn't currently include fabric-shim for
Hyperledger Fabric 2.2. You need to bundle this version of the library
in your Node.js application.

Boundary 2. The command required to package de chaincode (peer lifecycle chaincode package) says:

The peer lifecycle chaincode package explicitly excludes the
node_modules directory.

So, basically when I run npm i and tsc the project is built with no problem and I can run a node dist/index.js but it fails when the node_modules is missing because of the dependencies.
Any workaround about include the node_modules ""indirectly"" or package or bundle the dependencies?

The following is the normal and currently working method to call the program:
await program.value.rpc.sendTweet(topic, content, {
        accounts: {
            author: wallet.value.publicKey,
            tweet: tweet.publicKey,
            systemProgram: web3.SystemProgram.programId,
        },
        signers: [tweet]
    })

And this is the struct on the rust side
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SendTweet<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = author, space = Tweet::LEN)]
    pub tweet: Account<'info, Tweet>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub author: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(address = system_program::ID)]
    pub system_program: AccountInfo<'info>,
}

Instead I want to be able to manually compile, sign and send the transaction, so I've wrote the following:
const transactionInstruction = new TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [
        {pubkey: tweet.publicKey, isSigner: false, isWritable: true},
        {pubkey: wallet.value.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true}
    ],
    programId: programId,
    data: transactionInstructionAnchor.data
});

{...}

await web3.sendAndConfirmRawTransaction(connection, rawTransaction)


I see that the problem Might be inside the keys of the TransactionInstruction because I'm passing just 2 keys, but in the SendTweet accounts I'm passing 3 values:
accounts: {
        author: wallet.value.publicKey,
        tweet: tweet.publicKey,
        systemProgram: programId, // <--- THIS ONE ?
    },

I've tried adding to the keys this:
{
    pubkey: web3.SystemProgram.programId,
    isWritable: false,
    isSigner: false,
},

But it gives me the error: failed to send transaction: Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: Cross-program invocation with unauthorized signer or writable account

How does Consensys Quorum blockchain handle history of private contract data?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73486496/how-does-consensys-quorum-blockchain-handle-history-of-private-contract-data,0,0,76,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhptGBMXQhVH8piLD3GnXzMso_4MproR3Q6q0K4og=k-s32,"Aug 25, 2022 at 11:14",1,Niket Yende,https://stackoverflow.com/users/13738570/niket-yende,How does Consensys Quorum blockchain handle history of private contract data?,5 months ago,5 months ago,"I recently started exploring a use case on quorum and wanted some more clarity around below points:

How does a private contract participating node check the history of its private data? Is there any api to fetch the historical details(provenance) of this private data?
Is it possible to add more participants to the deployed private contract? Does quorum support dynamic addition of new node public keys in the privateFor list some point later in future?
Does quorum provide support for changing the privacyGroupId for a deployed private contract?
Can flexible privacy groups be enabled in Quorum? Reference: https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3js-quorum/blob/3723cfdeb249f788b8d4a7f3eb3b6e9bc920ec68/example/onChainPrivacy/addRemoveExample.js#L33
Does quorum support replication of intermediate private transaction which resulted in private data changes in case of a participant node went offline during these transactions?
Below is the example scenario:


Lets say Node1 initiates a private contract tx with Node2 & Node7 part of the initial privateFor participant list.
Let us assume initial value set in the contract was 42 which all the 3 participant nodes get into their respective node databases.
All three receive an updated snapshot value of the private data.
Due to certain circumstances Node7 becomes unavailable and crashes eventually.
Node1 tries to initiate one more private tx by setting the new value to 15 with the same list of participants.
Node2 get the latest update on the private data. However, Node7 is still under maintenance and does not know about any such update on the private data.
Node1 initiates 2 more private data tx's changing the value from 15 to 11 and subsequently changing it to 22.
By this time, Node7 manages to recover from its crash and receives the updated snapshot of private data in its db.
All participants will receive the latest value of private data ie. 22.
Does Node7 receive the intermediate private data tx's to ascertain change in private fata from 15 to 11 and then to 22?",blockchainethereumgo-ethereumquorum,"Aug 26, 2022 at 6:14",,"For point no. 2, 3 & 4, consensys quorum does not support flexible privacy groups like the Hyperledger Besu. However, Quorum does provide apis to extend the participants of an existing contract. Steps to add new participants to the existing private contract: 1. Initiate a contract extension transaction: Reference - consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/reference/api-methods/… 2. Retrieve the active extension contracts: quorumExtension_activeExtensionContracts 3. Approving the contract extension: quorumExtension_approveExtension

Solidity TransferFrom() function not working / Making an nft marketplace that accepts custom tokens,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73480903/solidity-transferfrom-function-not-working-making-an-nft-marketplace-that-ac,0,0,144,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ghij_0ZP-z8q75vfesVJdWxMTet51SSAz-7xAr0=k-s32,"Aug 25, 2022 at 1:14",1,mikeytable,https://stackoverflow.com/users/19194050/mikeytable,Solidity TransferFrom() function not working / Making an nft marketplace that accepts custom tokens,5 months ago,5 months ago,"So the plan is to make a basic nft marketplace in which you can buy with eth and with a custom token, the eth part works but I haven´t been able to make the custom token part work.
The token is already deployed to the mainnet, the nft marketplace will make use of it, so I forked the ethereum mainnet with hardhat so I could interact with it.
This is the buy with eth function:
function purchaseItemWithEth(uint _itemId) external payable nonReentrant {
        uint _totalPrice = getTotalPrice(_itemId);
        Item storage item = items[_itemId];
        require(_itemId > 0 && _itemId <= itemCount, ""item doesn't exist"");
        require(msg.value >= _totalPrice, ""not enough ether to cover item price and market fee"");
        require(!item.sold, ""item already sold"");
        // pay seller and feeAccount
        item.seller.transfer(item.price);
        feeAccount.transfer(_totalPrice - item.price);
        // update item to sold
        item.sold = true;
        // transfer nft to buyer
        item.nft.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, item.tokenId);
        // emit Bought event
        emit Bought(
            _itemId,
            address(item.nft),
            item.tokenId,
            item.price,
            item.priceOsaku,
            item.seller,
            msg.sender
        );
    } 

In theory, with the purchase with custom token function I would only need to change the token that is being sent, use the token instead of eth, so I made this:
function purchaseItemWithToken(uint _itemId) external payable nonReentrant {
        uint _totalPrice = getTotalPriceWithToken(_itemId;
        Item storage item = items[_itemId];
        require(_itemId > 0 && _itemId <= itemCount, ""item doesn't exist"");
        //require(msg.value >= _totalPrice, ""not enough ether to cover item price and market fee"");
        require(!item.sold, ""item already sold"");
        //pay seller and fee account
        depositTokens(10);
        sendTokens(item.seller, item.pricewithToken);
        sendTokens(feeAccount, (_totalPrice - item.pricewithToken));
        // update item to sold
        item.sold = true;
        // transfer nft to buyer
        item.nft.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, item.tokenId);
        // emit Bought event
        emit Bought(
            _itemId,
            address(item.nft),
            item.tokenId,
            item.price,
            item.priceToken,
            item.seller,
            msg.sender
        );
    }

    function getTotalPrice(uint _itemId) view public returns(uint){
        return((items[_itemId].price*(100 + feePercent))/100);
    }

    function getTotalPriceToken(uint _itemId) view public returns(uint) {
        return((items[_itemId].priceToken*(100 + feePercent))/100);
    }

    function depositTokens(uint _amount) public {
        ERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    }

    function sendTokens(address _to, uint _amount) public {
        ERC20(_token).transfer(_to, _amount);
    }

    function getTokenSmartContractBalance() external view returns(uint) {
        return ERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
    }

Buy it doesn't work.
I tried approving the token before the transferFrom function is called like this:
const name = await tokenContract.name()
    const approve = await tokenContract.connect(Buyer1Wallet).approve(publicKeyBuyer1, 1000000000)
    const approveMarketplace = await osakuContract.connect(Buyer1Wallet).approve('0xe8f7d98be6722d42f29b50500b0e318ef2be4fc8', 1000000000)
    console.log(approve)
    console.log(`${name} approved`)

But I get the error ""not enough ether to cover item price and market fee"" which is defined as one of the requires of the purchaseItem function.
It mentions it even though before approving I bought 1 eth worth of tokens via uniswap with this:
const apeBuyer1 = await uniswapContract.connect(Buyer1Wallet).swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
        99,
        PAIR_ADDRESS,
        publicKeyBuyer1,
        Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 5,
        {
            value: ethers.utils.parseUnits(String(1), ""ether""),
            gasLimit: 1000000,
            gasPrice: ethers.utils.parseUnits(String(50), ""gwei""),
        }
    )
    let receipt3 = await apeBuyer1.wait()
    console.log(`Buyer1 Bought: ${receipt3.transactionHash}`);

I don't know why it says it doesn't have enough balance when I a lot more than necessary for the function to run.

Now there is a question of architecture. Namely, as far as I understand, at the current iteration of blockchain development, smart contract technology, it is difficult to implement a decentralized application with only the capabilities of smart contracts as a server and a single point for organizing all business processes. That is, the limitations of data structures, the speed of reading data from the blockchain does not allow the system to be implemented fast enough.
Subject area for the application: supply chains of goods.
The entities in smart contracts will be as follows:

User: personal data, ID in the system, address, inventory (ID of the goods that the user currently owns)
Product: has data characterizing the product, product history (movement and condition, owners (links to addresses or user IDs))
Order (typical for legal entities: distributors, manufacturers, carriers): Confirmations from the parties to the agreement (transfer agreement), an array of product IDs (each product with an ID can be marked as transferred or not transferred, if during a real exchange of goods with the specified ID was), confirmation of the parties on the consent to the execution of the order

From here, thoughts appeared: to implement a hybrid architecture, where there will be an intermediate server with a database (as part of the MVP I will use supabase), where you can quickly aggregate data, read it, and the like.
The blockchain itself and smart contracts, in this case, will perform what functions?! Storing permanently committed transactions to reflect their fact, which makes it impossible to change the data. That is, the blockchain will, as it were, insure business processes from interference in them after the transaction is completed.
The blockchain itself in my case also needs a hybrid type. Hyperledger Fabric with its access by permissions is not suitable because:

The system (smart contract) assumes the use of roles with different levels of access to use the functions in the smart contract
(buyers) should also have access to the system (namely, to the blockchain) and mainly read data about the supply chain, for example, which way the product went to the client, the list of counterparties through whom the product passed, and any other data
it is possible to fill in some personal information about your account, which may be relevant for customers who were registered in the system by managers who sold the goods
only authorized users (approved by the administrator??) can have access to the deployment of new contracts and new blockchain nodes. This point is the most confusing, because the blockchain must also have the capabilities of public blockchains.
the very concept of cryptocurrency is not supposed to be used, that is, only the accounting function of the blockchain is of interest

Found options for implementing this kind of hybrid blockchains:

hyperledger sawtooth
hyperledger besu

In summary, the following questions:

is it possible to implement such a system in principle, that access to a smart contract and operations in them can be from ordinary people who connected to the blockchain network and created an account there using metamask
which blockchain platform should I use
since solidity has many limitations in the development of smart contracts, does it make sense to pay attention to the implementation of a smart contract in the javascript language (it is easier to work with complex data structures there) and maybe then you can completely abandon the intermediate server, the purpose of which is simply in convenient providing data
maybe you could suggest something else

I would like to write a simple query to find out Loopring NFT (non-fungible token) data using the Loopring subgraph, given a user account number. (Note the account number is the Loopring address, similar to an Ethereum address, a hexadecimal as string type)
The subgraph playground for Loopring is here: https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph?id=7QP7oCLbEAjejkp7wSLTD1zbRMSiDydAmALksBB5E6i1&view=Playground
Here is my code:
query accountNFTSlotsQuery(
  $skip:Int
  $first:Int
  $orderBy: AccountNFTSlot_orderBy
  $orderDirection:OrderDirection
  $where:AccountNFTSlot_filter
    ) {
  accountNFTSlots(
    skip : 0
    first: 100
    orderBy: createdAt
    orderDirection: asc
    where: {
      account: ""0x08F06d44D6D3e35a3790392571194d86090C863539277""

    balance
    nft {
      id
      nftType
      nftID
      mintedAt
    }
  }
}

The playground is returning...
{
  ""data"": {
    ""accountNFTSlots"": []
  }
}

Which I interpret as returning NULL, or ""no data found"". For the address above, one can verify NFTs exist using lexplorer:
https://lexplorer.io/account/39277
Variations:

I have tried several accounts which I know have NFTs.

I have tried replacing the ""account"" string with an ""id"" in the 'where' filter thus:
where: {
id: 39277

When I created my staking pool, I guess I used a different key then the key that I had set for my validator key. So my node was kicked off the network. The solution to this problem is supposed to be to update the key, but when I do that I get a permissions error. After trying to figure this out for days I am going to have to just create a new pool and start over. But that kind of sucks because I had 2000 shardnet tokens and what what I would like to do is get them back because the more tokens you have the more likely you are to get a seat.
It seems to me (i could be wrong here) that the issue is the near-cli software does not want to accept a custom key path. I have the private key for the staking pool, so this does not make a lot of sense to me. This is what happens when I try to update the key:
near call luminaryvision.factory.shardnet.near update_staking_key '{""stake_public_key"": ""ed25519:3EL542RuLDcUDeHXF2dJYfb73nhwAfs9GTXjrknxEqRd""}' --accountId luminaryvision.shardnet.near

""ServerTransactionError: {""index"":0,""kind"":{""ExecutionError"":""Smart contract panicked: panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`\n  left: `AccountId(\""luminaryvision.shardnet.near\"")`,\n right: `AccountId(\""luminaryvision\"")`: Can only be called by the owner', staking-farm/src/owner.rs:148:9""}}""

Full output here: https://termbin.com/jih0
When I try to unstake, I get a strange error ""amount to unstake must be positive"". But you can clearly see my staking pool has the near ...
$ near state luminaryvision.factory.shardnet.near

  storage_usage: 346690,
  formattedAmount: '0.143620184635167341594709'
}

I tried to give near-cli a custom key path but it still complains about not being able to find the key. The other thought i had was can I just use the key that I used for my stake pool as my validator key so that they match? Someone said i cannot do that, but I don't know why not. Is that an options?
Can anyone help me with this? Would be super appreciated.",blockchainnear,,Chev_603,"Add a comment

                Yeah, the second argument. I would use eth_getStorageAt(proxyContractAddress, 0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103)

The network is Binance Smartchain Testnet.
Here is one of the smart contracts
https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x6ae13e6B49Ab13d6D51060008d586aF48DE59b97#code
The chain definition
export const BSCTestnetChain: Chain = {
  chainId: 97,
  chainName: 'BSC Testnet',
  isTestChain: true,
  isLocalChain: false,
  multicallAddress: '0xae11C5B5f29A6a25e955F0CB8ddCc416f522AF5C',
  getExplorerAddressLink: (address: string) =>
    `https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/${address}`,
  getExplorerTransactionLink: (transactionHash: string) =>
    `https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/${transactionHash}`,
  // Optional parameters:
  rpcUrl: 'https://data-seed-prebsc-2-s3.binance.org:8545/',
  blockExplorerUrl: 'https://testnet.bscscan.io',
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: 'BNB',
    symbol: 'BNB',
    decimals: 18,
  },
};

The example of a call:
export function useX11Ballance(address: string | Falsy) {
  const { value, error } =
    useCall({
      contract: x11Contract, // instance of called contract
      method: 'balanceOf', // Method to be called
      args: [address], // Method arguments - address to be checked for balance
    }) ?? {};
  if (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
    return undefined;
  }
  return value?.[0];
}

Example of an error:
react_devtools_backend.js:4026 processing response error (body=""{\""jsonrpc\"":\""2.0\"",\""id\"":96,\""error\"":{\""code\"":-32000,\""message\"":\""execution reverted\""}}\n"", error={""code"":-32000}, requestBody=""{\""method\"":\""eth_call\"",\""params\"":[{\""to\"":\""0xae11c5b5f29a6a25e955f0cb8ddcc416f522af5c\"",\""data\"":\""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\""},\""0x14ca18e\""],\""id\"":96,\""jsonrpc\"":\""2.0\""}"", requestMethod=""POST"", url=""https://data-seed-prebsc-2-s3.binance.org:8545/"", code=SERVER_ERROR, version=web/5.6.1)

It doesn't even say what the extra chargeable step(s) is/are.
Near as I can determine, the chargeable steps are:
Alice publishes wager and deadline, and pays the wager into the contract
Bob pays the wager into the contract
Loop:
  Alice publishes a ""commitment"" to her hand
  Bob publishes his hand
  Alice publishes her hand.

So for each iteration of the loop (i.e., from the bets being placed until there's a non-draw outcome), ""Alice"" has an extra ""publish.""
Now, of course, one solution would be for ""Bob"" to publish a commitment to his hand. That would make it symmetrical, but can saddling a participant with an unnecessary chargeable step, just so both participants pay the same fee to the blockchain, truly be called ""fair""?

Can I run ICO without having much money?
What are actually the steps to pass ICO?
Having a parallel of USDT on ERC20/TRC20 - there is no real evidence that these guys have available USD to cover emited USDT, does it mean I can create some yet another USD-stable coin and announce that it's fully covered by the company (which I could register the same day)?",blockchaincryptocurrencyerc20ether,,Solomon Levit,"Add a comment

So what is its mechanism? for example we want to transfer 100 Links tokens from ethereum to binance smart chain. Its mechanism is like mint 100 tokens in ethereum chain and then burn 100 tokens in binance smart chain or we lock assets in smart contract of this chain and unlock assets in the smart contract of another chain.
After watching the video below, I am quite confused so is the binance smart chain a special chain when there is a special mechanism or is it still locking assets in the smart contract of this chain and unlocking assets in smart contract of another chain.

are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions. See 'solc --license'
for details.

Usage: solc [options] [input_file...]
Compiles the given Solidity input files (or the standard input if none given or
""-"" is used as a file name) and outputs the components specified in the options
at standard output or in files in the output directory, if specified.
Imports are automatically read from the filesystem, but it is also possible to
remap paths using the context:prefix=path syntax.
Example:
solc --bin -o /tmp/solcoutput dapp-bin=/usr/local/lib/dapp-bin contract.sol

General Information:
  --help               Show help message and exit.
  --version            Show version and exit.
  --license            Show licensing information and exit.
  --input-file arg     input file

Input Options:
  --base-path path     Use the given path as the root of the source tree
                       instead of the root of the filesystem.
  --include-path path  Make an additional source directory available to the
                       default import callback. Use this option if you want to
                       import contracts whose location is not fixed in relation
                       to your main source tree, e.g. third-party libraries
                       installed using a package manager. Can be used multiple
                       times. Can only be used if base path has a non-empty
                       value.
  --allow-paths path(s)
                       Allow a given path for imports. A list of paths can be
                       supplied by separating them with a comma.
  --ignore-missing     Ignore missing files.
  --error-recovery     Enables additional parser error recovery.

Output Options:
  -o [ --output-dir ] path
                       If given, creates one file per component and
                       contract/file at the specified directory.
  --overwrite          Overwrite existing files (used together with -o).
  --evm-version version (=london)
                       Select desired EVM version. Either homestead,
                       tangerineWhistle, spuriousDragon, byzantium,
                       constantinople, petersburg, istanbul, berlin or london.
  --experimental-via-ir
                       Deprecated synonym of --via-ir.
  --via-ir             Turn on compilation mode via the IR.
  --revert-strings debug,default,strip,verboseDebug
                       Strip revert (and require) reason strings or add
                       additional debugging information.
  --debug-info arg (=ast-id,location,snippet)
                       Debug info components to be included in the produced EVM
                       assembly and Yul code. Value can be all, none or a
                       comma-separated list containing one or more of the
                       following components: ast-id, location, snippet.
  --stop-after stage   Stop execution after the given compiler stage. Valid
                       options: ""parsing"".

Alternative Input Modes:
  --standard-json      Switch to Standard JSON input / output mode, ignoring
                       all options. It reads from standard input, if no input
                       file was given, otherwise it reads from the provided
                       input file. The result will be written to standard
                       output.
  --link               Switch to linker mode, ignoring all options apart from
                       --libraries and modify binaries in place.
  --assemble           Switch to assembly mode, ignoring all options except
                       --machine, --yul-dialect, --optimize and
                       --yul-optimizations and assumes input is assembly.

                       --machine, --yul-dialect, --optimize and
                       --yul-optimizations and assumes input is Yul.
  --strict-assembly    Switch to strict assembly mode, ignoring all options
                       except --machine, --yul-dialect, --optimize and
                       --yul-optimizations and assumes input is strict
                       assembly.
  --import-ast         Import ASTs to be compiled, assumes input holds the AST
                       in compact JSON format. Supported Inputs is the output
                       of the --standard-json or the one produced by
                       --combined-json ast
  --lsp                Switch to language server mode (""LSP""). Allows the
                       compiler to be used as an analysis backend for your
                       favourite IDE.

Assembly Mode Options:
  --machine evm,ewasm  Target machine in assembly or Yul mode.
  --yul-dialect evm,ewasm
                       Input dialect to use in assembly or yul mode.

Output Formatting:
  --pretty-json        Output JSON in pretty format.
  --json-indent N (=2) Indent pretty-printed JSON with N spaces. Enables
                       '--pretty-json' automatically.
  --color              Force colored output.
  --no-color           Explicitly disable colored output, disabling terminal
                       auto-detection.
  --error-codes        Output error codes.

Output Components:
  --ast-compact-json   AST of all source files in a compact JSON format.
  --asm                EVM assembly of the contracts.

  --opcodes            Opcodes of the contracts.
  --bin                Binary of the contracts in hex.
  --bin-runtime        Binary of the runtime part of the contracts in hex.
  --abi                ABI specification of the contracts.
  --ir                 Intermediate Representation (IR) of all contracts.
  --ir-optimized       Optimized intermediate Representation (IR) of all
                       contracts.
  --ewasm              Ewasm text representation of all contracts
                       (EXPERIMENTAL).
  --ewasm-ir           Intermediate representation (IR) converted to a form
                       that can be translated directly into Ewasm text
                       representation (EXPERIMENTAL).
  --hashes             Function signature hashes of the contracts.

                       Encode division and modulo operations with their precise
                       operators instead of multiplication with slack
                       variables.
  --model-checker-engine all,bmc,chc,none (=none)
                       Select model checker engine.
  --model-checker-invariants default,all,contract,reentrancy (=default)
                       Select whether to report inferred contract inductive
                       invariants. Multiple types of invariants can be selected
                       at the same time, separated by a comma and no spaces. By
                       default no invariants are reported.
  --model-checker-show-unproved

                       Select model checker verification targets. Multiple
                       targets can be selected at the same time, separated by a
                       comma and no spaces. By default all targets except
                       underflow and overflow are selected.
  --model-checker-timeout ms
                       Set model checker timeout per query in milliseconds. The
                       default is a deterministic resource limit. A timeout of
                       0 means no resource/time restrictions for any query.

I create a single node cluster by following the instructions in: https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start. Then, I deploy a program and start sending random transactions to it at a rate that I provide as an argument to my benchmark. I want to send a total of 10000txs at a rate of 160 tps which seems not to be very large.
Problem: After some time, I check the logs and the node starts retrying transactions and eventually drops them after they expire.

The odd thing I notice is that although I miss approximately a 40% of transactions sent, this won't happen if instead of the bootstrap-node.sh, I use the solana-test-validator without any extra arguments, where the transactions are all successfully executed even if use a way bigger tps rate.
The command I execute is the following:
./multinode-demo/bootstrap-validator.sh \
                        --enable-rpc-transaction-history \
                        --enable-cpi-and-log-storage \
                        --gossip-host $1 \
                        --allow-private-addr \
                        --log $LOGS/validator.log & 

Both $LOGS and $1 are guaranteed to be there and correct.
Since I use the same machine for both nodes, I cannot figure out how the node behaves differently in each run. I guess I miss something in my node configuration but cannot tell what it is.
I am using solana version 1.10.24
Also, I notice that when running the benchmark with solana-test-validator, the resources spent are low, despite the fact that all the transactions are executed:

On the contrary, the benchmark with bootstrap-validator.sh consumes way more resources while also dropping a handful of transactions, which is weird:

This is why I believe it has something to do with the node configuration.
Disclaimer: I know my server specs are way lower than the recommended, however this seems not to be the case here.
Please let me know if I need to provide any additional information on this topic.
Any help will be appreciated, thank you very much.",transactionsblockchainsolanapending-transitionprivate-cluster,,al96,"Add a comment

Packaging chaincode
Installing chaincode for each peer
Query installed chaincode (succesfull for each peer)

Check commit readiness (succesfull for each peer)
Commit chaincode

Increase number of Nodes in Network but limit number TCP enabled,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73040419/increase-number-of-nodes-in-network-but-limit-number-tcp-enabled,0,0,30,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgQP_UNo2pAFVa_GLvS-Rj4ZseRQRSGHz0npPOC=k-s32,"Jul 19, 2022 at 16:21",59,Hamilton Hardy,https://stackoverflow.com/users/16477030/hamilton-hardy,Increase number of Nodes in Network but limit number TCP enabled,7 months ago,7 months ago,"I am building off the XO game from the sawtooth SDK and am running into several issues. First, I am able to sucessfully modify the XOHandler to modify the type of data I am uploading to the network. I have been working with the shell default so I am a little unfamiliar with how the other containers work. I am running some tests and need to run a network with 100, 500 and, 1000 nodes respectivly. I am using a docker enviorment and the yaml file that specifies 5 total validators. For my network I am doing a quorum based consensus so I only want maybe 10 validators that are tcp enabled. Is their a good way of simulating this scenario? I thought I would just need to add a bunch of validators directly in the yaml file but I found this in the Sawtooth documentation. https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/sysadmin_guide/pbft_adding_removing_node.html#adding-a-pbft-node-label
This is confusing to me because it sounds like these are the steps taken for the Ubuntu Sawtooth install. I just copied the sawtooth core off of github so I am not sure which steps I should be following. I also have the issue of the yoml file. I found some stuff mentioning that this file stored some information about the validators however when I go the ./etc/sawtooth/ directory inside the docker their is no yoml file. Am I in the wrong place? That is the first question.
Second question concerns the Dependencies array in the transaction header. My network is designed in a way that I will need dependencies set between different blocks. I am also doing a one block per batch network. Whenever I would add dependencies however I run a RepeatGossip error and it says the block has already been added. My input and output fields are the same. Any feedback on this message? Of course the parent has already been added but specifying the parents in dependencies shouldn't block the block upload.",yamlblockchainhyperledger-sawtooth,"Jul 19, 2022 at 16:26",,"Add a comment

I am passing an interface as parameter as follows:

I've tried the hash function (hash token) but it changes on every call. Also, the describe-module function has the hash property what could be nice, but this cannot be called within a module.
I could store the hash when I load the module and pass it to the function but it is not useful because I would like to be able to call some methods in the interface.",interfaceblockchainpactkadena,,datoga,"Add a comment

Use smart contract to send to address (take so many fees to do that)
Use a queue to manage routes when user requests and block if have many specific route.

How to Use Private key to encrypt a message and decrypt it using the same block's public key?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72953333/how-to-use-private-key-to-encrypt-a-message-and-decrypt-it-using-the-same-block,0,0,288,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GguPEXwVLYsgzBZr9SbC6leHcomv3ajEisNDojZAw=k-s32,"Jul 12, 2022 at 13:43",25,Rahul Thakur,https://stackoverflow.com/users/14253537/rahul-thakur,How to Use Private key to encrypt a message and decrypt it using the same block's public key?,7 months ago,7 months ago,"I am building a DApp where I want to add a message to all the blocks that shows that the blocks are created by the same company i.e my website and no one can replicate that message. So, I think the best way is to add a message to every block that is encrypted using the block's private key and anyone else can decrypt the message using the block's public key. Is this possible? If yes, then how? I am using web3.js and solidity.
P.S- I know the concept of digital signature it is pretty much the same...but in my case I don't want to verify the user who has signed the block but I just want to verify if the block is from my website or not.",encryptionblockchainsoliditydigital-signatureprivate-key,,Rahul Thakur,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                Nevertheless, use a signature. If you want to create a small signature, use a 256 bit elliptic curve (64 bytes). Any somewhat good encryption routine will take at least as many bytes of overhead. And, to be honest, any answer that does goes into creating such a ""ciphertext"" will go over your head and might not be secure.

                I’m voting to close this question because this is not about development, this is about Cryptography. But we've got a selection of questions that address that signature generation is different from encryption with the private key over there.

                Note that there is such a thing a signatures giving message recovering for e.g. RSA. However, you got to keep in mind that that will likely expand the message more than ECDSA, and the standard is outdated and barely used (see here for more info).

in the network I designed, the government CA (which has the function to sign documents) acts as a network builder. In the network, users who use digital signature services number up to hundreds of different organizations. And to use the digital signature service, the user must send the hash of the PDF document along with the passphrase (digital certificate password). The user must submit a passphrase because the digital certificate is stored in the HSM government CA.
the question is, how to secure the passphrase (sensitive data of each user) in hyperledger fabric 2.4 when sent to the government CA, so that the passphrase data is not recorded or read in the ledger, but can be known by the government CA to sign the PDF document?",encryptionhyperledger-fabricblockchaindigital-signature,"Jul 8, 2022 at 20:41",david_k,"Take a look at Private Data.

I am trying to implement this protocol in dart using flutter and I am stuck at the HD derivation path.
HD structure

concatenate the little endian representation of index with the URI.
Compute the SHA256 hash of the result.
take first 128 bits of the hash and split it into four 32-bit numbers A, B, C, D (each in little endian notation)
Set highest bits of numbers A, B, C, D to 1.
Derive the HD node m/13’/A’/B’/C’/D’ according to BIP32.

In Digi-ID (an extension of the protocol in the Digibyte blockchain) integration guide, it gives an example for testing. I have successfully calculated the hash result but I am stuck at converting the hash to bip32 paths.

Those lazy minted NFT could be a potential threat because they can be minted in large quantities for free.
Is there a way to detect if NFT assets are lazy minted using OpenSea API?
By default OpenSea API returns both lazy minted NFT and those that are on-chain.
Is there a way to filter lazy minted one?
Fore example this API call retrieves an asset:
https://api.opensea.io/api/v1/asset/{asset_contract_address}/{token_id}/

There is a boolean property ""is_presale"": true in the response. Is this the one that indicates that the NFT is lazy minted?
{
  ""id"": 12345,
  ""num_sales"": 0,
  ""background_color"": null,
  ""image_url"": ""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xxx"",
  // ...
  ""last_sale"": null,
  ""top_bid"": null,
  ""listing_date"": null,
  ""is_presale"": true,// is this a flag that NFT is lazy minted???
  ""transfer_fee_payment_token"": null,
}

I've also noticed that lazy minted NFTs often contain a much longer token URI, for ex.:
0xabcd947276749ce646f68ac8c2484200abadbabe/1234567890278879774873980199088900019547633730998071615740870393857

whereas minted NFTs often have something like this:
0xabcd947276749ce646f68ac8c2484200abadbabe/12345

So I'm thinking maybe as an alternative, there is a way to know that an NFT is lazy minted by analyzing its tokenURI or smart contract?",blockchainethereumsmartcontractsnftopensea,,Mark Vital,"Add a comment

                yes, you need to have my custom token in order to call this function. If you want, send me your address, and I can send you some tokens. Also, before calling buyTicket() function you need to do the approval for that amount for the Lottery smart contract to be allowed to spend your tokens. I can send you the source of the token contract too, so that you can call that function. And, btw tokens are created on ropsten testnet

For some reason in both nodes my discovery ports is set to 0 I feel like that could be the issue but have not been able to find the way to change it. I was under the impression when you set ports both discovery and listener are set to that value.

On a traditional CRUD back-end, it just receives requests from the front-end, normally queries a centralized database then returns the relevant data.
However, I am aware that a dApp doesn't necessarily need a back-end as the blockchain already acts as that.
So my question is basically, when is a centralized back-end needed or encouraged for a dApp?
As a follow-up, I'm also unsure on how the back-end is supposed to authenticate users. That is, is there a way to connect with Metamask and the likes to identify the user making requests?
A particular use-case I would like to explore is an NFT marketplace. What's the purpose of a back-end for something like that? I'm sure it'll be useful for saving user data not on the blockchain, but are blockchain-specific data also advisable to be store offchain?",backendblockchainethereumdecentralized-applications,,SnoopBoard,"Opensea for example makes you sign a message to authenticate with their backend.

                @pguardiario, how then is the private key for a particular address gotten? Passing it on or storing it on the backend doesn't seem secure.

                You use the private key to sign the message, and their backend can verify that it was signed without knowing the private key

Getting CALL_EXCEPTION when requesting balanceOf with ethersjs,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72794694/getting-call-exception-when-requesting-balanceof-with-ethersjs,0,0,198,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f9adc1390fc2e8a64b201113b2e2797?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,"Jun 29, 2022 at 1:05",411,Nischit Pradhan,https://stackoverflow.com/users/8353165/nischit-pradhan,Getting CALL_EXCEPTION when requesting balanceOf with ethersjs,7 months ago,7 months ago,"I'm using VoidSigner with zero address to request balanceOf token. I'm calling this from nodejs application which doesn't have a real wallet attached. This seems like a very straight forward code and it should be working.
I'm creating provider as
ethers.getDefaultProvider(network.name, {
      etherscan: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY,
      infura: {
        projectId: process.env.INFURA_API_KEY,
        projectSecret: process.env.INFURA_SECRET_KEY,
      },
      alchemy: process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY,
      pocket: {
        applicationId: process.env.POCKET_API_KEY,
        applicationSecretKey: process.POCKET_SECRET_KEY,
      },
    });

I'm calling the balanceOf api as
const getBalanceOf = async ({ chainId, account, tokenAddress }) => {
  // using generic Erc20 contract abi because every token extends this so every token will have balanceOf
  const signer = new ethers.VoidSigner(ethers.constants.AddressZero, provider[chainId]);
  const token = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, ERC20Abi, signer);
  try {
    console.log(""account"", account);
    return await token.balanceOf(account);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
  return 0;
};

Calling this, the api succeeds sometimes and fails most of the times.
When it succeeds, I'm getting the correct response as
BigNumber { _hex: '0x00', _isBigNumber: true }

But most of the times its failing with.

I called this function from the explorer and everything worked and events were generated. But calling it from the Polkadot-JS API has not made any effect. I don't get a transaction hash return value, I don't see any changes on-chain, I don't see any events deposited. Its just silent. Worse, it throws no errors. My chain function is correct, that is not the issue. Same thing happens when I add an account to the keystore, with password and seed. It doesn't reflect on the explorer. Please why is this happening? Thanks.
Also, when I call functions from default pallets, say balances.transfer(), it works. But it doesn't work with default functions. So I'm thinking maybe there's still some configuration of some sort to be done. Please help me.

                substrate.stackexchange.com is a better place to ask this, but fo sure need more detail on what you are doing. Specifically what explorer, what errors, what pallet fn, etc.

In testing I have found that the contract correctly appends the payable fee to the remaining gas cost to perform the rest of the contracts functionality (i.e. normal contract interaction would cost .001 ether, I add a fee of 1 ether and now the function interaction costs 1.001 ether.
However my concern is in times of high latency if metamask does not correctly predict gas fees is it possible that my my contract will take the payable fee however not have enough gas to complete the minting process of the NFT? Meaning the customer would have spent their money but receive nothing in return?
Another follow-up question regarding this is that when I set a payable function I have to manually input the amount of ether to send. Is there a way to set up a payable function that metamask will automatically interpret and add the fee preventing the need to manually input a ether value and allowing the user to just click 'mint'?",blockchainsoliditysmartcontractsnftremix,,Tolki,"Add a comment

                Most blockchain networks are public, so they are not really suitable for storing sensitive data. Plus I'd be very hesitant to store even encrypted sensitive data on a public blockchain - it's the same security risk as allowing read access to another database holding encrypted private data... What is your intention/goal for this approach or storing PPI related to NFT? Maybe there's a solution using a private blockchain network, or an offchain service storing the data accessible through some onchain authorization.

I want to transfer the variable image_uri into another Python script.
The best attempt so far I have succeeded with:
from scripts.upload_to_pinata import main
image_uri = main()
image_uri_from_upload = image_uri

However, the problem arises here that I take over all commands and other variables from main. I would like to take over however ONLY the one variable.
Does anyone have a solution, idea or suggestion how I can transfer only the one variable between the Python scripts?
Here is a part of the script in which the variable should be inserted.
from scripts.upload_to_pinata import main

image_uri = main()
image_uri_from_upload = image_uri

image_uri_from_upload = """"

Thanks in advance for the support.",pythonvariablesblockchaintransmission,,maxver,"the important part is image_uri = ""{}{}"".format(first_part_image_uri, ipfs_hash)... so to get an image_uri you need the values of those two variables.  first_part_image_uri seems like it must come from some code you didn't put in the question, and ipfs_hash is derived from the api response. Hard to tell what you really want

                it sounds like you need to take just the parts necessary to generate an image_uri from main and move them into a new function, say get_image_uri, and then you call that function in main and also import just the new function in your other script and call it there too

However, I would like to create more functions that use the existing mappings and arrays that the openzeppelin contracts come with.
For instance, I can call   balanceOf() since I inherit this function from openzeppelin

import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol"";

contract NFT is ERC721Enumerable, Ownable {

Notice that I never declared the function balanceOf() yet I can access it and behind the scenes the function will check the _balance mapping and find the _balance( address) .
However, I cannot run this code because the compiler cannot find the _balance() mapping.
So my question is: How to use or override mappings and arrays from inherited contracts like OpenZeppelin?",blockchainethereumsoliditysmartcontractsremix,,David Ruiz,"1
            
        
        
            
                
                You can't directly access _balance from the ERC721 contract because it's defined as a private mapping.  Also in the ERC721 contract it's _balances not _balance.  You can create a method that allows an external method to be called to change the users token balance but you will need to modify the ERC721 contract to do that, which is a bit more involved.

                Look like the .glb file wasn't properly encoded into a File object, but there's no way to know for sure without seeing the code using nft.storage API.

My goal is to have a fanout approach where each node must receive the message even if one acknowledges it first. My understanding is that I will need a different subscription for each of the nodes in order to achieve the above.
When I looked into the limitations, it seems like there's a maximum number of subscriptions per project which is 10,000.
How can I achieve a the above for more than that number? Or is PubSub not a possible option for my implementation?
If not, do you recommend a specific alternative?
I'm aware of p2p methods used in other networks, but the issue there is speed of delivery which makes the network extremely slow with growth. In my case I do not care or even prefer the PubSub system to be centralised, so the ""decentralised"" argument here is not valid.
I thought of simply having my nodes ""not acknowledging"" messages, but that can be abused by anyone who touches the distributed code, and I'm not sure what other issues will arise from that.
Should I maybe have multiple projects, each with similar configs, and randomly select some of the nodes that will be listening to one and publishing to another to ""relay"" messages?
Any feedback, guidance, direction would be greatly appreciated.",google-cloud-platformblockchainpublish-subscribegoogle-cloud-pubsub,,Waelmas,"3
            
        
        
            
                
                If your limit is the number of subscription per project, I agree, create several projects. However, you can have a topic in one project and be reachable from another one. Similarly, you can have a subscription in a project and the topic in another project. There is no relay to create for that. However, pulling subscription is optimized, but it's still HTTP network traffic and if you have large volume of data, you will have similar network issues. Not sure that this design resolve that issue..

                On one hand the number of subscriptions seems to be a soft-limit based on documentation, but on the other hand I'm thinking about the network quotas as well. I'm not 100% I understand clearly those limits mentioned here: cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas#quotas (In general my message size is about 15-20KB that needs to be published to all subscriptions/nodes). Worst case I might introduce local messaging queues?

                I agree with @guillaumeblaquiere's comment. And regarding the local messaging queues, this will give more durable message delivery mechanism and will probably eliminate the network issues since you will not be needing to connect over a network in sending/receiving messages.

                Do all of the subscriptions need to be on the same topic? If so, you will also run up against the 10,000 subscriptions per topic limit.

                Yes they all listen to the same type of data. Any node of the network can produce transaction data which all nodes need to receive to take it into account when preparing the next transaction/block and when calculating the remaining balance of an address.  I'm considering moving to AWS SQS for production as it seems their limits are much higher. Otherwise a self-hosted solution.

web3.eth.getPastLogs({fromBlock:0, address: ""0x9F0927b4998A4267ccc91F2818ADA193817691Bf"",topics:[""0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef""]})

Why do sender and minter should be same on minting NFT?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72141993/why-do-sender-and-minter-should-be-same-on-minting-nft,0,0,77,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2942908613fa664eb8e5f7ca69c436?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG,"May 6, 2022 at 13:08",3,Kenji Fukuda,https://stackoverflow.com/users/18455841/kenji-fukuda,Why do sender and minter should be same on minting NFT?,9 months ago,9 months ago,"I am developing NFT marketplace with terra and I use CW721.
And I noticed on mint function if the sender and minter is not equal it returns ""Unauthorized"" error.
I can ignore this condition but is this required?
pub fn mint(
        &self,
        deps: DepsMut,
        _env: Env,
        info: MessageInfo,
        msg: MintMsg<T>,

        let minter = self.minter.load(deps.storage)?;

        if info.sender != minter {
            return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized {});
        }
        ...
    }

In Javascript with Terra.js I sent request with my wallet address.
But if the sender and minter must be same, I have to send request with minter's wallet address.
And that means NFT creator should know the password of minter's wallet.
What's the difference between token_uri and image url?
I think they are same.",rustblockchainnftterra-blockchain,"May 13, 2022 at 5:17",Cornelius Roemer,"Please clarify your specific problem or provide additional details to highlight exactly what you need.

How to securely implement a deadpool in a PoW blockchain?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72134769/how-to-securely-implement-a-deadpool-in-a-pow-blockchain,0,0,28,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bed6ce3df2c509836d0b6bf045ccbcb?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG,"May 5, 2022 at 23:58",1,factorn,https://stackoverflow.com/users/17773608/factorn,How to securely implement a deadpool in a PoW blockchain?,9 months ago,9 months ago,"Imagine you have a blockchain where the Proof of Work scheme is integer factorization. There is an opcode that takes two integers N,M where it returns true if M∉{0,1,N} and N mod M ≡ 0. Now, suppose we want a number factored, say Mg. It could be a Cunningham number, a brilliant number or any other number where there is an interest in knowing its factorization.
We can create a transaction where the locking script for the funds of the transaction is this opcode with Mg as the first input. This way the unlocking script is just any non-trivial factor of Mg. This would allow anyone on the blockchain to claim the reward for this factorization.
Two issues: miner-in-the-middle attack and reorganization attack.
Miner-in-the-Middle Attack: The miner who receives a transaction with the unlocking script will be able to see the factor in plain sight and replace that transaction with one where the funds are sent to their wallets instead of the solver's.
Reorganization Attack: If the value of the blockchain's coin is high there is also an incentive to attack the block in which a solver transaction was mined by re-solving that block with a replaced transaction accrediting themselves(the attacker) and attempting to create a longer chain from this new block.
So,the question becomes, how can solutions be submitted safely in this blockchain? Is it possible to do it in two transactions, or are three transactions required? Is there any blockchain that has solved this problem already?
Thank you.
Note 1: I choose tags that are the most related to this topic. It also seems like the bitcoin stack exchange is strictly for bitcoin.
Note 2: This question was posted on the cryptography stack exchange to get ideas on cryptographic mechanisms that might help implement this. It is also posted here because there is a blockchain tag and there may be implementation details and solutions which may be achieved with the current opcode set plus this new opcode. It seems this community stack exchange is the most suited for the latter.",securitycryptographyrsablockchaincryptocurrency,,factorn,"I’m voting to close this question because this isn't a programming question, it's a crypto question.
