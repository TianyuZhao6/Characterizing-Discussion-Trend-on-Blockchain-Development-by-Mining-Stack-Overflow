However, information is very limited since this is a newer implementation of the blockchain.\n\nJust as an example, say I want a contract that holds information about a person. Is it more efficient to create a new contract for each person, or simply hold information about all users in the same contract?\n\nIn pseudo-code, the two options look like this.\n\nOption 1 (instantiate a new contract for each person):\n\ncontract = \/\/ contract code\n\nethereum.newContract(contract, userInfo);\n\n\nOption 2 (hold info of all users in one contract):\n\ncontract = {\n  var users = [];\n\n  \/\/ other contract code\n}\n\nethereum.newContract(contract, userInfo);\n\n\nHere's how we can quantify \"efficiency\" in this case:\n\n\nEach time a new contract is instantiated, we have to mine the block for the contract, and then mine any transactions the user makes to the contract. If we only instantiate one contract, however, we only mine the contract deployment once, and then any transactions thereafter, but...\nIf we go with the option of storing all info for all users in one contract, is only the \"diff\" of the contract data (the \"array\" of all users) stored as a block, or is the entire set of data stored in every block? Or...\nIf we go with the option of \"contract per user\", does it \"waste space\" if we're storing the entire contract definition multiple times (and is it worth the possibly redundant mining that needs to take place)?\n\n\nHopefully I was clear in my question, but if not, please let me know. I believe this question is one of \"trade offs\".\n\n(Re: the tags -- I'm using the golang implementation of Ethereum, and a JavaScript API to interact with it.)","5":"When looking at sample contracts, sometimes arrays are declared in methods with \"memory\" and sometimes they aren't.

I hope, it matches the idea as expected of Smart Contract and Blockchain 2.0.\n\nProblem\n\nSuppose, I have received a 25 MB file from some one through some media. I would like to have it scanned for virus before I actually open it for use. How can I be sure that it is not infected?\n\nTraditional Solution \n\nPerhaps there is a cloud based service provided for virus scan - Virus Scanning as a Service (VSaaS). This provider has subscription plans based on file type, volume and frequency of scans. I could approach this provider to scan my file and receive a binary response as TRUE (clean) or FALSE (infected). But, I have no choice but to trust two things of the provider:\n\n\nDid the provider scan at all? Or, more generally, was 'work' done at all? Maybe, there is a tiny script to return TRUE and FALSE with 50% probability regardless of how many and what type of files are sent.\nWas the provider's scan conclusive? Maybe, the provider does not have all of the virus signatures to scan successfully. So, the provider may respond with TRUE (clean) whereas, it is actually infected with the latest strain of a virus.\n\n\nSmart Contract \n\nCan a distributed application (or, Smart Contract) resolve this problem? I know that the underlying blockchain provides a publicly available ledger that can verify:\n\n\nIf I have sufficient coins (say, BTC) to cover the scan service request.\nIf a scan request (the transaction in this case) was made, to whom, when, etc.\n\n\nWhat I do not know is, how do I answer the questions that I have for the traditional solution? That is, what is the mechanism to confirm that a virus scan did actually happen in its entirety? Should multiple 'full nodes' do a virus scan of the same file? If so, am I not spreading my ambiguity across multiple full nodes (in effect, different cloud providers in a conventional way) now?\n\nHow would an Ethereum platform address this requirement?","16":"How can I send the JSON object \"data\" returned by the npm module \"blockchain.info\" in the callback \"onRequest\".

That means, I want to start a new blockchain for nodes on my LAN, they should connect only within themselves via the peer discovery method that is exactly like the actual bitcoin network. First time a node joins this custom network, it should connect to custom hardcoded nodes(as I have disabled DNS discovery in my code) by sending version and verack messages and then exchange getaddr and addr messages to discover other nodes on the network.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0bawejakunal\n                \n                Oct 22, 2015 at 14:58\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Despite the fact that this question should probably be moved to the bitcoin site, it's an interesting one.

BUT -- the contents of that storage can be changed with sendTransaction calls. Such calls change \u00e2\u0080\u009cstate\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is why contract-level variables are called \u00e2\u0080\u009cstate variables\u00e2\u0080\u009d. So a variable uint8 storage var; declared at the contract level can be changed to any valid value of uint8 (0-255) but that \u00e2\u0080\u009cslot\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a value of type uint8 will always be there.\nIf you declare variables in functions without the memory keyword, then solidity will try to use the storage structure, which currently compiles, but can produce unexpected results. memory tells solidity to create a chunk of space for the variable at method runtime, guaranteeing its size and structure for future use in that method.\nmemory cannot be used at the contract level. Only in methods.\nSee the the entry \"What is the memory keyword? What does it do?\" in the FAQ. I quote it here:\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine has three areas where it can store items.\nThe first is \u00e2\u0080\u009cstorage\u00e2\u0080\u009d, where all the contract state variables reside. Every contract has its own storage and it is persistent between function calls and quite expensive to use.\nThe second is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmemory\u00e2\u0080\u009d, this is used to hold temporary values. It is erased between (external) function calls and is cheaper to use.\nThe third one is the stack, which is used to hold small local variables. It is almost free to use, but can only hold a limited amount of values.\nFor almost all types, you cannot specify where they should be stored, because they are copied everytime they are used.\nThe types where the so-called storage location is important are structs and arrays. If you e.g. pass such variables in function calls, their data is not copied if it can stay in memory or stay in storage. This means that you can modify their content in the called function and these modifications will still be visible in the caller.\n\nThere are defaults for the storage location depending on which type of variable it concerns:\n\nstate variables are always in storage\nfunction arguments are always in memory\nlocal variables of struct, array or mapping type reference storage by default\nlocal variables of value type (i.e. neither array, nor struct nor mapping) are stored in the stack","6":"Python 3.x changed print statement to be print functions\n\nPython 2.x:\n\nprint \"Hello World\" \n\n\nPython 3.x\n\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n\nSo because you are running on python 3.x you will need to update your code to use the 3.x print style (e.g., print function calls).\n\nprint( json.dumps(evaluate(), indent=4) )","7":null,"8":"$transactions is a PHP array, not an object.

This means that contract code is not deployed to a specific node; rather, it is deployed to a distributed ledger of which each node has a copy (assuming that each node has reached consensus with the rest of the network). Likewise, when you call a function of a contract, the function call is executed at least on those nodes in your network that are actively mining (validating transactions).\n\nContracts are created by broadcasting a transaction to the network. Functions on deployed contracts are called also by broadcasting a transaction.\n\nPreparation of the transaction that creates a contract returns the address of the contract. This address references the unique location of the contract on the blockchain; record it. When you send that transaction to the blockchain, wait for the current block to be mined. Once that happens, all nodes should have a copy of the code within a few milliseconds and can then process transactions that call functions in that contract.\n\nOnce the contract is created, prepare another transaction that calls a function, referencing as the recipient of the transaction the contract address that you previously recorded. Then, broadcast this transaction to the network. It doesn't matter which node receives the transaction first. Eventually, shortly after the transaction is mined, all nodes in the network will have an updated state of the blockchain that reflects any changes that resulted from the function call.","15":null,"16":"data doesn't exist in the scope of onRequest.

BUT -- the contents of that storage can be changed with sendTransaction calls. Such calls change \u00e2\u0080\u009cstate\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is why contract-level variables are called \u00e2\u0080\u009cstate variables\u00e2\u0080\u009d. So a variable uint8 storage var; declared at the contract level can be changed to any valid value of uint8 (0-255) but that \u00e2\u0080\u009cslot\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a value of type uint8 will always be there.\nIf you declare variables in functions without the memory keyword, then solidity will try to use the storage structure, which currently compiles, but can produce unexpected results. memory tells solidity to create a chunk of space for the variable at method runtime, guaranteeing its size and structure for future use in that method.\nmemory cannot be used at the contract level. Only in methods.\nSee the the entry \"What is the memory keyword? What does it do?\" in the FAQ. I quote it here:\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine has three areas where it can store items.\nThe first is \u00e2\u0080\u009cstorage\u00e2\u0080\u009d, where all the contract state variables reside. Every contract has its own storage and it is persistent between function calls and quite expensive to use.\nThe second is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmemory\u00e2\u0080\u009d, this is used to hold temporary values. It is erased between (external) function calls and is cheaper to use.\nThe third one is the stack, which is used to hold small local variables. It is almost free to use, but can only hold a limited amount of values.\nFor almost all types, you cannot specify where they should be stored, because they are copied everytime they are used.\nThe types where the so-called storage location is important are structs and arrays. If you e.g. pass such variables in function calls, their data is not copied if it can stay in memory or stay in storage. This means that you can modify their content in the called function and these modifications will still be visible in the caller.\n\nThere are defaults for the storage location depending on which type of variable it concerns:\n\nstate variables are always in storage\nfunction arguments are always in memory\nlocal variables of struct, array or mapping type reference storage by default\nlocal variables of value type (i.e. neither array, nor struct nor mapping) are stored in the stack","6":null,"7":null,"8":"$transactions is a PHP array, not an object.

Block Header Validity.\n\nThe Genesis Block does not indicate on which Blockchain a miner works. This is defined by connecting to the right peer-to-peer network or, if you are using the discovery mechanism on a network with multiple Blockchains running, using the network ID. \n\nThe (Genesis) Block describes the parameters of this specific Block and they are set according to the Miner's algorithm. Of course, any illegal behavior will be rejected by the consensus mechanism.\n\nIn conclusion, you can use the same GB for all custom Blockchains.\n\nThe values that have to be of correct in terms of mathematical validation are nonce (Proof of Work), mixhash (Fowler\u00e2\u0080\u0093Noll\u00e2\u0080\u0093Vo reduced DAG value set), timestamp (creation time). The geeky values in this example are a copy from the original Frontier release Genesis Block. The parentHash points to the parent block in the chain and the Genesis Block is the only Block where 0 is allowed and required. alloc allows to \"pre-fill\" accounts with Ether, but that's not needed here since we can mine Ether very quickly. \n\nThe difficulty defines the condition to satisfy by the Miner (hash) algorithm to find a valid block. On a test network, it's generally kept small in order to find a block for every iteration. This is useful for testing since needed to execute transactions on the Blockchain. The block generation frequency is kind of the response time of the Blockchain.\n\nThe gasLimit is the upper limit of Gas that a transaction can burn. It's inherited into the next Block. extraData is 32 bytes of free text where you can et(h)ernalise smart things on the Blockchain :) The coinbase is the address that got the mining and transaction execution rewards, in Ether, for this Block. It can be 0 here, since it will be set for each new block according to the coinbase of the Miner that found the Block (and added the transactions).\n\nI have documented this a bit more in detail here.\n\nHope this helps :)","19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null},"# of Vote for A3":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":6.0,"18":-1.0,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null},"User for A3":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null},"A3_answered_time":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null},"Comment or A3":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","18":"Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, it would be preferable to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0q9f\n                \n                Aug 27, 2016 at 10:05\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null},"Answer4":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":"I used this method to concat strings.
