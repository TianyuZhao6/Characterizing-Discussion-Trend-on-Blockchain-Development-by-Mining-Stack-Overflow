Now most of the certs expire and the cluster crash, including both tls and identity certs.\nI tried to fix by completely removing old certs and private keys, generate and enroll new identities for peer, peer admin, orderer, orderer admin.\nEverything works again, but I cannot instantiate\/upgrade chaincode in existing channel because the channel was configured with old admin certs.\nProblem\nSo now look like I'm stuck in a deadlock. In order to update channel config with new cert, I need to sign the update with matching old cert, which is already expired and blocked by orderer.\nI find out that we can disable expired cert check in orderer using ORDERER_GENERAL_AUTHENTICATION_NOEXPIRATIONCHECKS=true. But now I don't have the old admin private key so I still cannot update the channel config.\nQuestions\nI already replaced old private keys with new one so there is no way to use the old cert again.\nCan I do something to resolve this channel issue?\nSuggestions are greatly appreciated.","45":"I am getting started with Application development on Matic.

To get more players I added a token which the players can earn. I want them to stake their tokens to receive some of the profit the game makes. All the ETH the game makes goes into a treasury contract. That's the same contract where people can stake their tokens. I want them to have a \"pending ETH reward\" which they can withdraw on their cost. Similar to sushiswap with the difference that there isn't a fixed amount of reward per block.

The app allows you to \"donate\" or send tokens to others.\nI need to make the token total for a user change in real time after making a donation. My problem is that the Ethereum blockchain takes about 15 seconds to update the totals on-chain, and  currently the reducer is reaching out to the blockchain to grab the wallet balances immediately after the donation. We don't want to make the user sit and watch a spinner for 15 seconds, but we also want the value of their wallet to reflect the transaction immediately.\nOne solution I can think of is to just add or subtract the proper number of tokens totally within the state of the application, and only reach out to the Ethereum API on loading the application.

We went with a Hybrid blockchain where certain personal information will be private and other stuff like credentials will be public so that educational institutes can validate them.

An account is created on Node-A and shared with Node-B. From Node-A We have requested a publickey using  new RequestKeyForAccount(accountInfo). Node-B is not aware of this public key. So to synchronize the public keys We have invoked new SyncKeyMappingFlow(flowSession, Collections.singletonList(anonymousParty)) from Node-A. We have also implemented a responder flow on Node-B which invokes the new SyncKeyMappingFlowHandler(flowSession)) subflow. Both the initiator and responder flow are working fine. When tried to look up the List of publickeys belonging to the account on the Node-B using accountService.accountKeys(accountInfo.getState().getData().getLinearId().getId()).toString()) we are getting an Empty list. Ideally we should be getting the public key that we requested on the Node-A. Is this this the appropriate approach to synchronize the public keys?

That implies that funds (msg.value ?) and owner (msg.sender ?) are transfered within the functions calling transaction to the DeFi smart contracts.\nEOA = A wallet with a bit of ETH to pay fees\nRelay = The relay smart contract, which must receive funds from the DeFi smart contracts (= as being the msg.sender ?)\nproxyDeFi = The proxy smart contract which allow to send multiple requests to one or multiple DeFi smart contracts within one transaction\nIt seems to me that delegatecall allows to pass the msg.sender and the msg.value in the execution of a function of another smart contract, so what I did so far:\nThe proxyDeFi is working as intended when called by the EOA, but proxyDeFi is the msg.sender for the queried DeFi smart contracts, not EOA.\nWe will need several proxy contracts which could be updated often, so I tried to make a simple relay:\ncontract Relay {\n    address public proxyDeFi;\n    address owner = msg.sender;\n    \n    modifier isOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Forbidden\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function update(address newAddress) isOwner public {\n        proxyDeFi = newAddress;\n    }\n\n    fallback() isOwner external payable {\n        proxyDeFi.delegatecall(msg.data);\n    }\n}\n\nI tried to call proxyDeFi's functions to Relay (with EOA), but the transaction is systematically reverted on the deletegateCall.

The management of this supply chain implies to track-and-trace (geolocate) a drug on the chain, but also to monitor the storage temperature to see if the cold chain is respected. For that I created a mock-up of the POC my Dapps (https:\/\/balsamiq.cloud\/sum5oq5\/p8lsped)and also I wanted to prepare myself by doing a UML and a use cases. However, I didn't find a lot of information about blockchain's UML and use cases besides two literatures which were quite different, so I don't know if what I did was correct or not...\n\nThe users of my Dapps will be the following ones:\n\nThe stakeholders (Manufacturers, Distributors and Retailers) which will use the Dapps to place orders and also monitor them. They also can search in the historic a specific order. Finally, trough IOT sensors they update the conditions of the order (temperature & location).\nThe administrator which roles is to update the Dapps and its rules. But also to add or delete user while also defining the rights that they have on the blockchain (I intend to use a permisionned blockchain). Finally, they are also here to help in case of technical problem.\n\n\nThe Dapps that I'm thinking about works in the following:\n\nA user, the customer, can place an order (a list of products) to a\ncertain seller and choose the final destination of the order.\nThe order is then put together before being shipped or stocked in the\ndepots of one of the stakeholders (distributor or retailer) with a\ndescription of the stocking and\/or shipping condition of the product\n(for example the product must be stocked or transported in a room\nwith a temperature of less than 5\u00c2\u00b0C). During the shipping and\nstoring, an IOT device will feed the drops with the temperature and\ngeolocation of the product by updating the data each 5-10mn.\nObviously they will be a function that allows all the users to see\nthe history of the order passed and search inside a specific order.\nIn case where the temperature doesn't respect the temperature\nrecommended, then the smart-contract send an alert. The same if the\ncollocation of the product is \"weird\" like being in some European\ncountries and not in an Asian country, an alert will be sent again by\nthe smart-contractual.

For example when we have a bank account record in the state, with a balance. We would post a debit or credit transaction to the ledger that would need to read the current balance of the account, and decrease or increase it. This would possibly involve putting a lock on the account state record until the change is completed. Are there any examples of this, how can this be done properly in chaincode to ensure data consistency?","203":"I understand bitcoin transactions can have multiple inputs\/outputs but I'm intrigued on how payment providers confirm the receipt of payment in a 3rd party wallet?\nI understand that once you are inside a wallet, you have a different perspective of the transaction and therefore you can provide a clear view to the user about that specific transaction - as you know which addresses belong to that wallet.\nBut, is there a way to guess, or get closer to an aggregation of the value of the transaction that doesnt belong to a wallet you own? So we could show it clearly to the user: How much was sent, from where to and how much. Ok there may be multiple outputs, which we have to show, but we can aggregate them and show the sum of the transaction.\nIn the end of the day, once you send a transaction id to a recipient (as proof of payment), they want to see your wallet, their wallet and the total amount which was paid. Not 15 inputs and another 29 outputs, confirmations, and all that stuff.\nI get it, its all very important and yadayadayada.\nBut I'm trying to put together an explorer where it would be easier to show (to a Bitcoin normal user) a transaction in a simple way (without all those inputs and outputs), but something simpler as From, To, Value, Fee, and that's it.\nI understand that, by design, the blockchain doesn't work that way.

This is a new\n#   concept as of v1.1.0 and should not be utilized in mixed networks with\n#   v1.0.x peers and orderers.  Capabilities define features which must be\n#   present in a fabric binary for that binary to safely participate in the\n#   fabric network.  For instance, if a new MSP type is added, newer binaries\n#   might recognize and validate the signatures from this type, while older\n#   binaries without this support would be unable to validate those\n#   transactions.  This could lead to different versions of the fabric binaries\n#   having different world states.  Instead, defining a capability for a channel\n#   informs those binaries without this capability that they must cease\n#   processing transactions until they have been upgraded.  For v1.0.x if any\n#   capabilities are defined (including a map with all capabilities turned off)\n#   then the v1.0.x peer will deliberately crash.\n#\n################################################################################\nCapabilities:\n    # Channel capabilities apply to both the orderers and the peers and must be\n    # supported by both.\n    # Set the value of the capability to true to require it.\n    Channel: &ChannelCapabilities\n        # V2_0 capability ensures that orderers and peers behave according\n        # to v2.0 channel capabilities.

For this purpose I am using IPFS to store the files and the blockchain(more specifically an ethereum network) to store the hashes for the files. As is the case in most such applications.\n\nHowever, the client is insistent on storing the files directly on the blockchain because of the linked list feature that ensures that the hash of every block on the blockchain is dependent on the previous block and as such every single hash depends on each other.\n\nDoes IPFS have a similar feature in it's data structure? I realize that the Merkle Tree system ensure that any tampering with any of the data chunks that the root hash references will change the root hash and as such allows verification of shared files. However, is there any feature that makes the hashes of files dependent on each other?\n\nPerhaps if the files were in some sort of directory structure?","353":"I want to perform a non-backwards compatible state upgrade using SignatureConstraint.

The error I keep getting when I try to create the channel is:\n\nError: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error validating channel creation transaction for new channel 'mychannel', could not successfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  \/Channel\/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\nMy versions for Docker images are:\n\n\nDocker engine version: 19.03.8;\nDocker CA image and version: hyperledger\/fabric-ca:1.4.6;\nDocker Peer image and version: hyperledger\/fabric-peer:2.0;\nDocker Orderer image and version: hyperledger\/fabric-orderer:2.0;\nDocker Tools (CLI) image and version: hyperledger\/fabric-tools:2.0.\n\n\n\nReproducing the error\n\n\n  I created a repository at GitHub where I put the codes referenced by the links: fabric-ca-operations-guide.\n\n\n\nI start by executing tearup-docker-cas.sh to create all the Docker images for the CAs and consequently the directory structures at \/tmp\/hyperledger\/:\n\ncurl -sSL https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/hanesbarbosa\/fabric-ca-operations-guide\/master\/tearup-docker-cas.sh | bash -s\nWhen I check that every image is up and running by issuing the command docker ps I create the crypto material using setup-crypto.sh:\n\ncurl -sSL https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/hanesbarbosa\/fabric-ca-operations-guide\/master\/setup-crypto.sh | bash -s\nThen I download the configtx.yaml file to my current directory:\n\ncurl -sSL https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/hanesbarbosa\/fabric-ca-operations-guide\/master\/configtx.yaml -o .\/configtx.yaml\nNow I am ready to set the environment variable FABRIC_CFG_PATH so that I can create the genesis block and channel transaction by the create_genesis_block_channel_tx.sh script. The artifacts will be available at \/tmp\/hyperledger\/org0\/orderer\/:\n\ncurl -sSL https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/hanesbarbosa\/fabric-ca-operations-guide\/master\/create_genesis_block_channel_tx.sh | bash -s\nSince the genesis block is available, now we can create the orderer image using tearup-docker-peers.sh. This script also creates all the peers and cli containers tools:\n\ncurl -sSL https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/hanesbarbosa\/fabric-ca-operations-guide\/master\/tearup-docker-peers.sh | bash -s\n\n\nAfter the step 5 I am ready to create the channel. Therefore I use the following command to use the cli-org1 container:\n\ndocker exec -it cli-org1 bash -c \"export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=\/tmp\/hyperledger\/org1\/admin\/msp; peer channel create -c mychannel -f \/tmp\/hyperledger\/assets\/mychannel.tx -o orderer1-org0:7050 --outputBlock \/tmp\/hyperledger\/assets\/mychannel.block --tls --cafile \/tmp\/hyperledger\/org1\/peer1\/tls-msp\/tlscacerts\/tls-0-0-0-0-7052.pem\"\n\n\nAt this point I get the error:\n\nError: got unexpected status: BAD_REQUEST -- error validating channel creation transaction for new channel 'mychannel', could not successfully apply update to template configuration: error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  \/Channel\/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied\n\n\nWhen I want to clean up everything for a fresh start I just execute:\n\ncurl -sSL https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/hanesbarbosa\/fabric-ca-operations-guide\/master\/teardown-docker.sh | bash -s\n\n\nFixing Attempts\n\n\nI always try a new attempt with a fresh set of crypto materials and images, so I always run the step 6 from the Reproducing the error section before trying again;\nI create the channel at the step 4 as the admin of the organization;\nI make sure the orderer has the TLS root signing certificate listed (everybody is using the same CA for TLS certs);\nThe environment variable ORDERER_GENERAL_LOGLEVEL is set to \"debug\" at the orderer image, so that I can have more detailed errors;\nI tried to sign the channel creation transaction (mychannel.tx) before issuing the command peer channel create to make sure it was not a lack of signature, but the error mentions a \/Channel\/Application group policy, that in this case is an Implicit Meta type, where the rule is \"ANY Admins\";\n\n\n    Organizations:\n\n    # Policies defines the set of policies at this level of the config tree\n    # For Application policies, their canonical path is\n    #   \/Channel\/Application\/<PolicyName>\n\n    Policies: &ApplicationDefaultPolicies\n        LifecycleEndorsement:\n            Type: ImplicitMeta\n            Rule: \"MAJORITY Endorsement\"\n        Endorsement:\n            Type: ImplicitMeta\n            Rule: \"MAJORITY Endorsement\"\n        Readers:\n            Type: ImplicitMeta\n            Rule: \"ANY Readers\"\n        Writers:\n            Type: ImplicitMeta\n            Rule: \"ANY Writers\"\n        Admins:\n            Type: ImplicitMeta\n            Rule: \"ANY Admins\"","363":"I want to write a chaincode in JAVA.

I know every block has a stored hash value of the content of the previous block plus some nonce.\n\nLet's say this blockchain(for simplicity, we use a linked-list style rather than a Merkle tree style) has 1000 blocks, and a hacker just changed the content inside of the 10-th block. Of course, if we recompute the hash of this 10-th block and compare it with the hash stored inside of the 11th block, it will be different, most probably. \n\nMy question is, should a blockchain-based system periodically check the hash inside of every block to detect if the content of a block is changed? In this case, if the system does not have a function to periodically recompute the hash of the 10-th block, it will not be able to detect the change, right? In other words, my question is how a blockchain-based system detects the change of a block?\n\nThanks","384":"CodeSandbox:

This solution should be used to provide the interactions bewtween manufacturers and suppliers. I supposed that in this case there should be a single blockchain ledger with information about manufactured goods. This ledger should be used both by manufacturers (to register new goods) and by suppliers (to update goods: for example, mark some item as delivered).\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric official documentation (https:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.0\/fabric_model.html#privacy) says that the ledger is strictly linked with a channel: \n\n\n  Blockquote\n  Hyperledger Fabric employs an immutable ledger on a per-channel basis, as well as chaincode that can manipulate and modify the current state of assets.\n\n\nSo I intended to create a single channel and install 2 different chaincodes on:\n\n\nchaincode for manufacturers (to register manufactured goods)\nchaincode for suppliers (to mark registered goods as delivered)\n\n\nBut when I prepared a demo application, I revealed, that the second chaincode cannot query the items created with the first one (i.e. each chaincode has an isolated ledger). \n\nHow can I deploy the ledger, which should be shared between organizations having various roles (access rights), if I don't want to force all of them (manufacturers and suppliers) to install the full chaincode (containing both 'register goods' and 'mark as delivered' operations) on their environment?\n\nThanks & Regards\n\nIgor Egorov","392":"I'm preparing a deployment scenario for some software solution based on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain ver. 2.0. I've reviewed the official docs and examples, but some points regarding the deployment\/support on real-world production environment are still unclear for me.\n\nLet's suppose that the designed blockchain network includes the following participants:\n\n\nthe Software Provider organization, which prepares and supports the basic blockchain infrastructure;\nthe consortium of N organizations (Org1, Org2, ..., OrgN) participating in business transactions over blockchain network \neach organization in consortium has a system administrator, which is more or less familiar with blockchain technology and Hyperledger Fabric\n\n\nThe approximate deployment scenario I've expected is:\n\n\nAll participants (Software Provider, Org1, Org2, ... OrgN) prepare required identities: choose their certificate authorities (CAs), get X.509 certificates, generate private and public keys for secured connection etc.\nThe Software Provider deploys the ordering node, creates the system channel and defines the consortium of N organizations. Therefore the Software Provider must obtain public identities (MSPs) of ALL participating organizations.\nAll organizations in consortium (Org1, Org2, ... OrgN) start at least one peer in their local environment.\nThe consortium agrees the business rules to be used on production. Based on this, some organization (for example, Org1) should create a business channel with the corresponding chaincode installed on. To do this, Org1 must have MSPs of ALL organizations to configure the business channel for the whole consortium.\nAll organizations join this business channel and only use their own MSPs (with private data) to be identified in the network.\nAfter that, Org1 installs the agreed chaincode on business channel. The required number of other organizations approves this chaincode. \nWhen approval is done, Org1 commits the chaincode definition.\nNow all organizations can use their own MSPs to interact with the committed chaincode (query ledger data and invoke smart contracts).\n\n\nFollowing this scenario I considered, that only 2 organizations (Software Provider and Org1) should somehow obtain public identities (MSPs) of ALL other consortium members. And for other organizations it is enough to use their own private MSPs to be properly authorized in the network.\n\nBut in fact at least on step#5 each organization technically must explicitly operate with MSPs of all consortium members. Here is a command to be executed on step#5 by every organization to register an anchor peer:\n\nconfigtxgen -profile TwoOrgsChannel -outputAnchorPeersUpdate .\/output\/channel-artifacts\/organchors.tx -channelID mychannel -asOrg OrgX\n\n\nThe above-mentioned TwoOrgsChannel profile is defined in channel configuration (configtx.yaml), which in turn contains links to MSPs of all organizations. This means, that during joining the channel every organization must use a local copy of channel configuration (configtx.yaml) and somehow receive local copies of all MSPs in consortium. It raises several questions at once:\n\na) For production scenario is it really required for every participating organization to have the MSPs of all other consortium members? Looks like it is very uncomfortable for organization administrator to manage this complex configuration manually...\n\nb) Why it is required to initiate anchor peers update explicitly by every organization, although the information about all anchor peers is already specified in initial channel configuration (configtx.yaml) used to prepare the genesis block for channel (by Org1)?\n\nc) What happens, if I skip the anchor peer update step?\n\nd) And, additionally, is there some way in Hyperledger Fabric to add some organization (or even unauthorized participants) having the read-only permission to access the ledger in some channel? For example, what should we do, if the customers someday ask us (as Software Provider) to give the access to ledger to audit companies?\n\nCould you please clarify these points?\n\nThanks & Regards\n\nIgor Egorov","393":"I am trying to import bitcoin blockchain into neo4j.\nThere are four files\n\n1- tx_header.csv - tx_hash:ID, timestamp\n2- outputs_headers.csv - tx_hash:ID, wallet_address:END_ID, amount\n3- inputs_headers.csv - wallet_address:START_ID, tx_hash:END_ID, amount\n4- add_headers.csv - wallet_address:ID\n\n\nwhich have header information and content details are in other csv files.

The append should be after the while loop.  You can move w = w + 1 out of the if block as well since you do that in either case after the if.  Beyond that, I don't think there's enough information here for the community to be of much more help.  Even if we could help, what you're talking about is the basic task of programming.  You have to run your program over and over, watch what it's doing (you should be using a good visual debugger), and expand it line by line by matching code to what you want the code to do.

One of the core properties of a blockchain is that it is unchangeable after it is signed by blocks higher up the chain. That would mean that public keys in the \"admins\" section cannot be changed. So, if you want to add a message to a later block that references \"your\" block, you have to sign the message with the private key that corresponds to a public key stored in \"your\" block. You could have a message type to add public keys which is also signed\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Artjom B.\n                \n                Sep 19, 2020 at 12:46\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                The architecture I made is poor in security. When the block owned by a private entity updates, it will query a public key (stored in one of the fields in the block) and along with it  either append, remove or change a particular key and\/or field stored in the block. So if you know the public key (prone to happen on a distributive ledger) that is allowed to change data, you can change a block that isn't yours and updates it further down the chain. I am certain I may have thought of a more secure way of doing this and I will share my findings when it works.

I'll try precise my question. I'm trying to understand if the blockchain structure is really needed in Hyperledger Fabric and other Hyperledger projects. Maybe another DLT could be enough (maybe DLT working only as log of operations)? For example Corda is a permissioned DLT and doesn't use blockchain. So maybe the blockchain structure in HLF is one of the many possibilities for this network to work and isn`t required?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Michal\n                \n                Aug 5, 2020 at 7:55\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                By checking the hash of the last block you can find out if the whole chain is correct. With the log of operations (or blocks but without previous blocks hashes) I could check it as well, it would only take more time to check. Is this time difference the only one that exists between the DLT based on the log of operations and the blockchain structure in HLF?

Your validator's container name is your URL. Something like tcp:\/\/container-validator:4004. Expose 4004 from your validator container.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Arun\n                \n                Apr 9, 2020 at 16:19\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @Arun  thank you so much for the reply. I changed my index.js file and now it looks like this -> new TransactionProcessor(\"tcp:\/\/sawtooth-validator-default:4004\") and in the same location my docker file expose like this -> EXPOSE 4004\/tcp.    I'm using sawtooth-validator-default validator from sawtooth docker composer.

The commonly used and de-facto standard implementation OpenSSH, for the latter case, uses a file for each user on the server, normally located under the user's home directory as $HOME\/.ssh\/authorized_keys, which lists the publickeys valid for that user. If the client process specifies a username and a publickey listed in that user's authorized_keys file, and uses the privatekey to sign certain data including a connection secret and nonces, that is considered to prove the identity of the user. (See RFC 4252 for details, but start with 4253 for context.) Other implementations need to have equivalent data, although not necessarily that exact file. The host\/server usually allows the user\/client to make several attempts, in case it has multiple keys and\/or other methods to try, but this is configurable.\nSSH by itself mostly doesn't control access; it just establishes the user\/client's identity as a username configured on the 'host'. Using that identity to control access -- what security people call authorization as opposed to identification and authentication -- depends on the host. Many SSH hosts are Unix, and for Unix the same rules apply to accessing Unix over SSH as apply to other kinds of connection: this starts with the classic 'chmod bits' on each file allowing read,write,execute to user,group,other, and can include other things like ACLs, SELinux attributes, sudo rules, group match for signalling processes, special configuration of some things like NFS, and so on and so on. If the SSH host\/server is NOT Unix, what security rules or policies it applies once you have connected and authenticated it are up to it and may be quite different.\nOpenSSH (on a Unix host) also implements a few options in the authorized_keys file that impose additional restrictions on what the client can do (over that connection); see man sshd on your system or here under AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT. In addition, as noted there, OpenSSH supports a level of indirection: instead of directly listing every key in each applicable user's authorized_keys file you can use a (designated) 'CA' key to sign other keys, and then configure authorized_keys to accept any key signed by a listed CA key. These certificates can themselves include some restrictions; see man ssh-keygen under CERTIFICATES.

There is no central authority that acts as an arbitrator or monitor. As a distributed log of records, there is greater transparency \u00e2\u0080\u0093 making fraud and manipulation more difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it is more complicated to hack the system.\nAll of this could well be familiar because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written about the features of blockchain as well.\nBlockchain:\nBlockchain is nothing else but a DLT with a specific set of features. It is also a shared database \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a log of records \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but in this case shared by means of blocks that, as the name indicates, form a chain. The blocks are closed by a type of cryptographic signature called a \u00e2\u0080\u0098hash\u00e2\u0080\u0099; the next block begins with that same \u00e2\u0080\u0098hash\u00e2\u0080\u0099, a kind of wax seal. That is how it is verified that the encrypted information has not been manipulated and that it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be manipulated.\n\nDLT platforms that are not blockchain provide immutability too, but it's just the way Hyperledger Fabric provides this characteristic which makes it a blockchain framework.\nEvery blockchain framework, be it the Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc all store the transaction information in blocks, where each block is linked to its predecessor by a hash and provides immutability.\nCorda is very much similar to Hyperledger Fabric, but it is said to be both a blockchain and not a blockchain. Architecturally, it's very much similar to Hyperleder Fabric, but with only a key difference which makes Hyperledger Fabric a blockchain framework, and Corda a DLT.\nI'll try to answer your question by emphasizing on the point that why Corda is not a blockchain.\nWhy is Corda a blockchain, and not a blockchain?\n\nA Transaction in Corda is cryptographically linked (chained) to the transactions it depends on. Just like Bitcoin, but the range of concepts that can be expressed is far wider.\n\nTransactions in Corda are processed by having each participant in the transaction execute the same code deterministically to verify the proposed updates to the ledger. Just like Ethereum, but the languages you can use are high-level and productive, like Java, rather than obscure ones like Solidity.\n\nTransactions in Corda are shared only with those who have a need to know. Just like channels in Fabric but designed in from day one and fully integrated into the programming model.\n\nTransactions in Corda are confirmed through a process of consensus forming using one of a range of algorithms, including Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithms. Just like any other blockchain, but with the unique features that a Corda network can support multiple different consensus pools using different algorithms.\n\n\nSo, for all intents and purposes, Corda is a blockchain. And yet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an utterly critical difference.\nUnlike the platforms mentioned above, Corda does not periodically batch up transactions needing confirmation\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008ainto a block\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aand confirm them in one go. Instead, Corda confirms each transaction in real-time. No need to wait for a bunch of other transactions to come along. No need to wait for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblock interval\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Each transaction is confirmed as we go.\nNow coming onto your question why Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) uses blockchain structure? The answer is simply because they chose to.\nReferences:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bbva.com\/en\/difference-dlt-blockchain\/\n\nhttps:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/what-is-the-difference-between-blockchain-and-dlt\n\nhttps:\/\/www.corda.net\/blog\/corda-top-ten-facts-7-both-a-blockchain-and-not-a-blockchain\/","183":"The _start basically points to the byte index in bytes array where the integer value starts.

A transaction is sent to an endorser in the form of a transaction proposal.  All endorsing peers are also committing peers (i.e. they write to the ledger).\n\nIn order for all peers of all organization(s) to end up with the same state, a transaction in Hyperledger Fabric goes through three phases.\n\nExecute\nOrder\nValidate\n\nMore on transaction flow.\nThe first note to make here is that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a separation between the execution of a transaction (Execute step) and actually updating the ledger (Validate step). This separation has useful effects:\n\nAll peers need to update the ledger, so all peers do the Validate step. But not every peer needs to Execute the smart contract. Hyperledger Fabric uses endorsement policies to define which peers need to execute which transactions. This means that a given chaincode (smart contract) can be kept private from peers that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t part of the endorsement policy.\n\nTransactions can be executed before they are put in order. This allows peers to execute transactions in parallel, which can improve throughput.\n\nIn Fabric\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three-step execute-order-validate model, the results of executing chaincode for a transaction are explicitly agreed upon (according to the endorsement policy) before the transaction is added to the ledger.\n\n\nEndorsement policies:\n\nEvery chaincode has an endorsement policy that specifies the set of peers on a channel that must execute chaincode and endorse the execution results in order for the transaction to be considered valid. These endorsement policies define the organizations (through their peers) who must \u00e2\u0080\u009cendorse\u00e2\u0080\u009d (i.e., approve of) the execution of a proposal.\n\nAs part of the transaction validation step performed by the peers, each validating peer checks to make sure that the transaction contains the appropriate number of endorsements and that they are from the expected sources (both of these are specified in the endorsement policy). The endorsements are also checked to make sure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re valid (i.e., that they are valid signatures from valid certificates).\n\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we've two organizations with single peer each(peer0.org1.example.com, peer0.org2.example.com). Let's say they both are endorsing peers. For some reason, the peer0.org2.example.com goes malign(could be due to any reason e.g. secretly & directly changing the world state of a key in peer's associated CouchDB) and starts endorsing fraud transaction proposals. Now, how would our network decide which transaction proposal is valid and which is not as they both are being endorsed by one valid and one invalid? A consensus would never be achieved and the transaction proposal would never reach the subsequent phases and will get rejected. That's why we need to find a balance between security and performance, by setting the correct number of endorsing peers. Generally, more the number of endorsing peers, greater is the chance of mitigating these kinds of attacks.\nYou can set endorsement policies at many levels:\n\nchaincode-level endorsement policie\ncollection-level endorsement policies\nkey-level endorsement policies\n\nIf a peer has chaincode installed on it, can act as an endorser. If clients invoke the installed chaincode on the peer, then it will act as an endorser.\nYou can decide whether a particular peer can act as an endorsing peer or not by setting the value of endorsingPeer to true\/false in network-config. Though this file belongs to version 1.4 I'm sure you'll find a corresponding network-config in the latest versions as well.\nReferences:\n\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/kokster\/hyperledger-fabric-endorsing-transactions-3c1b7251a709\n\nhttps:\/\/hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.2\/endorsement-policies.html#endorsement-policies","185":"Hyperledger Fabric's Raft based ordering service uses the etcdraft implementation.\nAs documented in this issue the CIFS filesystem type (here, implemented by SMB \/ Samba) does not properly support all of the filesystem operations necessary for the etcd WAL implementation to function safely.

First of all, you create a public\/private key pair. A public\/private key pair is the result of some complicated mathematics. What you can do with these keys is interesting. You can sign a message with your private key. If your friend has your public key, they can verify that the signature is valid for that message, which means that they can verify that it was you writing that message.\nIn blockchain, an address is the sha256 hash of a public key.\nNow when it is time to transfer your money, you need to do two things:\n\nShow that you are the owner of that address. You do that by providing the public key. The miners in this case can hash your public key to verify that it results in the 'from' address.\nConfirm that you own the private key. You do that by creating the signature of the transaction data.\n\nIf a miner changes the 'to' address, the 'from' address, or the amount, the signature of the transaction data isn't valid anymore.\nIf a miner decides to add a new signature based on the changed data, it won't verify anymore with the public key in the transaction.\nIf the miner decides to change both the signature and the public so they match, then the 'from' address won't be correct anymore as it is the hash of the public key.\nI left out some details like:\n\nA 'from' address refers to a previous transaction\nThe amount in the previous transaction needs to be spend completely. So if there is too much in there, you will have a second 'to' address which is in your control, basically transferring the rest back to yourself\nThere can be many 'from' addresses and 'to' addresses in one transaction. Each 'from' address requires a public key and signature.\nThe transaction actually contains a script that says how to verify the addresses and signatures. If you expand the language used in that script, then you are talking about a smart contract.\nThere are private keys which can generate multiple public keys, and therefore multiple address, so you don't have to manage multiple private keys.\nThere is no way to verify if a 'to' address is valid. So you can transfer money to an address where nobody has the private key for.\n\nYou can find the complicated details of what goes into a transaction here: https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Transaction","190":"Based off your second image it doesn't look like your 1 Org Local Fabric started properly in the first place (you have no gateways and for some reason your wallets aren't grouped together!).\nIf you teardown your 1 Org Local Fabric then start it again hopefully it'll work.","191":null,"192":"If you haven't configured or you're not using discovery service, then disable it in file query.js.\nDiable discovery service by setting discovery: { enabled: false } in statement await gateway.connect(ccp, { wallet, identity: 'appUser', discovery: { enabled: true, asLocalhost: true } });","193":"The application creates and discards a buffer on every iteration of the loop.

You can also refer to examples in the section ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest.\nNow, coming onto the question that you asked which is, how can we add OR condition within Org member, client, admin, peer. Check the below example, which is originally from the node SDK documentation.\nEndorsement policy: \"Signed by admin of the ordererOrg and any member from one of the peer organizations\"\n{\n  identities: [\n    { role: { name: \"member\", mspId: \"peerOrg1\" }},\n    { role: { name: \"member\", mspId: \"peerOrg2\" }},\n    { role: { name: \"admin\", mspId: \"ordererOrg\" }}\n  ],\n  policy: {\n    \"2-of\": [\n      { \"signed-by\": 2},\n      { \"1-of\": [{ \"signed-by\": 0 }, { \"signed-by\": 1 }]}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nAs you can see the only identities can be either admin or member that you can specify in your endorsement-policies. A member here can be any member apart from the admin. It can be a peer, client, user. If you want it to be signed by an admin, you'll have to specify explicitly in role object with value admin for the property name.\nFor your case, I think the following structure will be apt.\n{\n  identities: [\n    { role: { name: \"member\", mspId: \"peerOrg1\" }},\n    { role: { name: \"admin\", mspId: \"peerOrg1\" }},\n    { role: { name: \"member\", mspId: \"peerOrg2\" }},\n    { role: { name: \"admin\", mspId: \"peerOrg2\" }}\n  ],\n  policy: {\n    \"2-of\": [\n      { \"1-of\": [{ \"signed-by\": 0 }, { \"signed-by\": 1 }]}\n      { \"1-of\": [{ \"signed-by\": 2 }, { \"signed-by\": 3 }]}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nSadly, I couldn't find more examples of endorsement-policies in node-sdk but I think above examples would do the job in explaining its working.\nAlso, I think this will help you in a better understanding of what members and admins are in an endorsement policy.","195":"Have you tried GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor inside your chaincode directory?\nIf the above solution didn't work then you can follow this answer.","196":"All of these async functions are running on the same thread.

Each input spent output of another transaction, and value of output is specified in that vOut.\nThus, for compute the input transaction value, you need iterate of vIns of your transaction.

Blockchain scalability as a concept has wider significance in terms of scalability of a blockchain network, node, protocol etc. Blockchain scalability can be measured in terms of a collection of parameters such as transactions per second, latency, response time etc. It is the ability of a blockchain network to scale as per the demands of the participating nodes. \n\nBlockchain performance is quite a subjective term in comparison with scalability. Performance is the current throughput from any live system. Blockchain performance could be measured in terms of the current capacity of nodes and network to manage data at rest and data in motion. It could be measured in terms of the total active users and total concurrent users. Performance improvement and performance optimisation can be done without scaling the system. In the world of blockchain systems, methods like pruning, zero knowledge proofs, compression etc. are widely adopted performance improvement techniques. \n\nThe following diagram from the art of scalability book is a great illustration of the different measures of scalability such as scale by cloning, scale by functional decomposition and scale by partitoning. These are three different ways to scale systems. Systems of blockchain protocols can also be scaled in three ways like this. One is scaling by increasing the number of identical nodes ( cloning ). Another approach is scaling by introducing different layers ( side chains, state channels etc. ).

There are drawbacks such as the replication rate and limitations such as the block size.\n\nSo I recommend using an off-chain storage system. A common approach is using IPFS, a P2P distributed storage system. IPFS provides availability, higher performance and integrity (as files are referenced by their hash). The IPFS hash can be saved suitably on the blockchain. IPFS is available as a public P2P network, but you can also deploy your own private IPFS network.\n\nIf using IPFS, I also recommend using IPFS-Cluster over IPFS, to manage persistence and replication.\n\n\nhttps:\/\/ipfs.io\/\nhttps:\/\/cluster.ipfs.io\/\n\n\nIf you need encryption (maybe you don't), you should implement it outside IPFS (in your clients).

This is a hash and a height of a block. The peer checks if they have this block already and checks it is the same as the checkpoints they are using, if they do not yet have the block corresponding to this inventory and the hash is the same as their checkpoints then they save the inventory. They keep asking for inventories until they have an inventory all the way up to the chain tip. At this point they recursively ask for each block corresponding to the inventories they have saved. Once they get the block they validate it and save it - updating the UTXO set and txindex (if enabled) as they go. This is called IBD and is done when the node has been offline. When a node is online and a block is found the peer that found the block will \"rumor\" the block with all the peers it has. Basically it sends the hash and the height (yes the inventory of the block) to all its connected peers, if a peer does not have that block yet then it asks for the block data and gets the block. Then all the peers do the same, they send the inventory of the new block to all their connected peers (other than the peer(s) that they received the block from). \n\nI don't know of any simple to follow syncing code in python (though a google search should wield results (search for toy cryptocurrency python), it is not in python and works for DAG based blockchains instead but i am in the process of writing the following syncing code (it is not finished and is horribly messy). It is written in rust and uses my self made rust p2p lib build on top of tcpstreams\/sockets\n\nTLDR;\nNew nodes ask for a list of the hashes of blocks since the last block they have, they then save this and ask for the corresponding block from the peer. Existing nodes send a hash and height pair to connected nodes when they hear about a new block, when a node receives this they check if they have the block - if they haven't then they ask for the block data, validate the block, save it and enact it. They then send the same hash and height pair to all their connected nodes.\n\nI hope this helps answer your question!","369":"If you want to perform the manual steps, you need to start from here (with any previous fabric networks down\/removed) and follow all the steps in the order as listed on that page.","370":"Here:\n\nclass PubSub {\n  constructor({ blockchain, transactionPool, wallet }) {\n\n\nand here:\n\nconst testPubSub = new PubSub()\n\n\nSo, for this specific constructor call, the destructuring in the PubSub constructor amounts to\n\nconst { blockchain, transactionPool, wallet } = undefined;\n\n\nAnd you can't do that, neither with undefined nor with null.

They would not be working on a forked chain for long enough to outpace the network, wasting time and resources. It requires at least 51% (on average) the hashpower of the network to outpace the main chain and is called a 51% attack.

Outside of studies, thesis and some edge cases, there are few companies invested in AI compared to Cloud Computing, I would still consider it a very niche subject. It might be more prominent in the coming future, but right now depending on where you're located, it might be a rough path to get a job now. \n\nIf you're looking into those subjects, you might be interested in Machine Learning and Data Science. ML is not entirely AI, but related to it, and it's closely tied with Cloud Computing today. Most ML applications are Data Science related, which is taking an enormous role in the enterprise space. \n\nIf you have any questions, I might be able to answer regarding those 2 topics.

Again, it's the responsibility of each organization to protect the data stored in the network they're participating in.\n\n\nFor the point 2, the Hyperledger Sawtooth 2.0 proposed solution allows you to run multiple instances of the Validator as a service in a single process. That means you can have one physical node (also process) participating in multiple circuits providing isolation.\n\nBefore I end the answer for the benefit of others searching for an answer: Blockchain is not just a distributed storage but also a decentralized network. There are number of design patterns that allows us to keep the critical data outside the blockchain network and use the functionalities of the blockchain network (achieving consensus, smart contract verification to be specific) for what it is expected to do.","439":"When you make a raw transaction you specify inputs and outputs, for example:\n\nIf you have only 1 input with 10 BTC and 1 output with 7 BTC (the output could be someones address) the fee will be 3 BTC.\n\nTo make a 0 fee transaction the input BTC number should be the same as output (10 - 10 = 0).\n\nIf you try to broadcast a 0 fee transaction it will throw an error like \"Too low fee, set a higher fee\".","440":"According to https:\/\/hyperledger.github.io\/composer\/latest\/installing\/installing-prereqs#ubuntu\nIt seems though the version of Ubuntu is not supported. 16.04 - Xenial Xerus and 18.04 - Bionic Beaver are.

Put that next to your desired block time and you should have a good number. I would further reduce that to be safe as well. \n\nNote that the type of the data migration does matter here; If you are storing values, this is fairly easy and I assume you should be fine, since the bottleneck is probably decoding, not hashing. If your value (say, a large vec) is already so big that it cannot be read + written once in a block, then you have much bigger problems. With maps, you have to take into account that you will do more state lookups, so the whole process differs.","442":null,"443":"\"Denial of State\" could be caused if a rogue node builds a transaction and consumes a state which is shared between multiple parties. This is a trade-off of using non-validating notary as it doesn't validate the transaction against the contract code. The other parties would not be able to use the state anymore as it would already be consumed.","444":"What they meant is, when you receive a request to sign a transaction (i.e. you are the node that's running the responder flow); you shouldn't just blindly sign. I understand that the process is \"automatic\", but your automatic signature should be preceded with some business rules validation.  \n\nFor instance in the cordapp-example of the samples repo; the responder doesn't immediately sign; instead, first it checks that the received transaction produces an output of the expected type (i.e. IOU); otherwise someone for instance can send you a transaction with a different state of type Cash where you are the previous owner and they are the new owner, so if you sign without checking the state type; it's as if you gave them money! \n\nThen the responder checks that the IOU amount doesn't exceed a certain limit; so even though the initiator fulfilled all the required validations to get an IOU from you, that doesn't mean you're going to approve any amount; meaning let's say you're a Bank and someone gave you all the documentation to get a loan approval, that doesn't mean you're going to give them any amount they request (e.g. 10 Million $). \n\nSee the code here: \nhttps:\/\/github.com\/corda\/samples\/blob\/018502310b56bc1bb31440380af4b89e9bbd7ed8\/cordapp-example\/workflows-kotlin\/src\/main\/kotlin\/com\/example\/flow\/ExampleFlow.kt#L105","445":null,"446":null,"447":"You have a proxy interfering with your networking.

In this case, it is usually one address received 1 amount and the second address received change (back to the original owner). To understand what I mean, I'll explain how a transaction is created on Bitcoin.\n\nScenario\n\nUser A wants to send .1 BTC to user B. In order to do that, they must gather up enough previous transaction outputs (where they received Bitcoin) and use them as inputs to the new transaction. So, let's say last week user C sent .05 BTC to user A, and user D sent .1 BTC to user A. You might think user A can just grab the output from user D's transaction and send that to B, but you must include a small fee for the miner in order to get your transaction added to the a block in the blockchain (miners will almost never mine a transaction for free, they get paid the transaction fee, as well as the block reward when they mine a block).\n\nSo, in order to cover the fee, let's say it's 0.00003 BTC. User A needs to use both previous outputs so there will be a total of 0.15 BTC sent. Now, you have to spend all of the input, so user A would obviously not want to send that much if they only owe 0.1 BTC so user A will create a transaction which sends 0.1BTC to user A, and 0.04997 BTC (0.05 minus the transaction fee) back to themselves. This is called the change address, and usually is not the same as any address user A has previously used. This is for privacy reasons, so it is harder to tell who received the Bitcoin, and who got the change back if someone was trying to track users spending.","497":"3500 transactions per second means that on average, 3500 transactions were created by some clients and then appeared in some next newly created block within one second. \n\nIt can be that several blocks were created in that second. \n\nYou can't use Fabric, or any other consensus mechanism that uses IP networks for a real time application, simply because that if the network transmission can be delayed for more than 100ms.\n\nYou can, however - make the consensus service in Fabric use low batch timeouts (say, of 10ms) and then blocks would be formed on a frequent basis and you'll have a transaction latency less than 100ms on average.","498":"A Blockchain transaction can be defined as a small unit of task that is stored in public records.

Are tokens like objects that are instantiated from this contract?\n\nA contract is just an account in ethereum's state tree. Every account has a balance, a nonce, bytecode, and the root hash of a storage tree. For normal accounts, the byte code and storage hash are empty. For contracts, the bytecode is the contract's code and the storage hash is the merkle root hash of all the key-value pairs in the contract's storage. The only thing that goes in the block are the transactions themselves, and the merkle root hash of the entire state tree. To be a full node tho, you must keep all the key-value pairs for the state tree (where keys are addresses and values are serialized accounts) and for the storage trees for each contract account (where the keys are storage locations and values are storage values).\n\nEVM memory is transient. The EVM is not really a virtual machine (VM has a strong connotation for many) - it's just an interpreter for the EVM assembly language. As the interpreter runs, it maintains a stack (where each element is 32 bytes) and a memory byte-array, and has access to the contract's storage tree. The stack and memory byte-array are dropped when the execution completes. But yes, every single node runs the transaction - at any point in the execution, the state of the stack, the memory-byte array, the program counter, and the storage should be identical on each node.\n\nEvery node runs the interpreter for every transaction. It's just like bitcoin. Every node runs the little script that executes when you try to spend from a previously unspent output (assuming you know about bitcoin). The hash of the transaction isn't relevant until it is being stuffed into a merkle tree. When running the execution, all we care about is the amount of gas, the data being passed in, and the code of the contract that's being called. When the execution completes, the storage tree of the contract may be updated, so we recompute the merkle root hash of that tree (and any other contract which may have been called by that one!)\n\nThe state transition function has a series of parts. There's the part that updates account balances and nonces (the simple part), the part that handles gas and gas refunds, the part that executes EVM byte code (which can cause account balances and storage values to change), and the part that pays miners for mining blocks and uncles. This \"function\" is defined in detail in the yellow paper and implemented independently in each of the ethereum clients (c++, go, python, etc). The EVM, or what I'm calling the interpreter, is typically just a for loop that increments a program counter and has a big switch statement telling it what to do for each operation in the byte code (pop\/push the stack, load\/store memory, load\/store storage, call another contract, suicide, etc.)\n\nsource: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/3k4h3w\/basic_questions_about_the_ethereum_evm_and_state\/\n\n\n\nDoes that mean the Smart Contract is only run once and then just lives on the block chain.\n\nEvery node in the network executes smart contract code for each transaction that you call it. So, smart contracts runs every time that you call it and change its state.\nEvery node has to verify the results of a transaction which invokes a smart contract. The result is that at least every full node will execute the code.\n\nTake a look to ethereum development tutorial:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/wiki\/wiki\/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial","516":"You have two ways to potentially track how a state variable has changed over time:\n\n1) The contract has been developed so that when said variable is modified its previous state is added to an array which contains all previous states.\nex. check this contract events:\nhttps:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x3958b4ec427f8fa24eb60f42821760e88d485f7f#events\n\n\n\n2) the contract has been developed so when the state variable is modified it fires an Event that logs said transaction. \nTake a look to this post in consensys about events:\n\nhttps:\/\/media.consensys.net\/technical-introduction-to-events-and-logs-in-ethereum-a074d65dd61e\n\nThe article presents three use cases for events:\n\n\n  \"First, using an event to simply get a return value from a contract\n  function invoked with sendTransaction(). Second, using an event as an\n  asynchronous trigger with data, that can notify an observer such as a\n  UI. Third, using an event to write logs in the blockchain as a cheaper\n  form of storage.\"","517":null,"518":"From the chat of the go-sdk-fabric:\n\n\n  fabric-sdk-go is stable. The reason that still in beta just for missing some documentation \n\n\nThe package works but it is kind of a mess, the only documentation are the chainhero example, the test files and the go-doc. There are a lot of package and some of them seems to do the same but they're not always compatible with each other."},"# of Vote for

Deploying a contract is like deploying a service, no one would know about it if it is not published somehow. One could try and publish it on websites as ethresear.ch, Medium, Twitter, etc. Note, that in contrast to standard services, anyone in the network would notice a contract was deployed, but those interested to track this are probably not the standard users of the application.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Michael\n                \n                Dec 27, 2020 at 14:56\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","17":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","18":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","19":null,"20":"Is it the same case when updating\/upgrading a running substrate node?

After that you need to collect all endorsements from peers and have to make signed envelope. To send a signed envelope to orderers you need to broadcast your envelope to orderers with Send gRPC call where we need to create a AtomicBroadcastClient.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Ta-seen Junaid\n                \n                Sep 9, 2020 at 22:29\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Hyperledger Fabric Java SDK, Go SDK etc etc works as  gRPC clients, you can build your client by following those examples, test cases on those repository.

Once I've downloaded the parties.json and use it as a checking for the logins, I will always update the Web Application Daily since the Token will always be expired on Project DABL.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0cythe14\n                \n                Jul 16, 2020 at 13:58\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @cythe14 thanks!

What do you believe is centralized?  With the Raft based ordering service, each organization can bring their own ordering service nodes (OSNs) and be part of the ordering service.  They can bring their own peers, their own CAs, etc.  So it seems pretty decentralized to me.  Is it permissionless?  No, but that doesn't make it centralized.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Toddinpal\n                \n                Jun 9, 2020 at 12:39\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","264":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","265":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","266":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","267":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","268":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","269":"Yeah,I went through this video and did exactly for cordapp_example ,also tried with obligation_cordapp, for cordapp_example, only 1 flow is getting loaded on UI, ExampleFlow$Initiator and the other tabs are not getting populated on UI.

It's all clear in the example and my answer.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Adel Rustum\n                \n                Jan 21, 2020 at 17:00\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Hi Adel. But the student node can upload a file that has student as blacklisted. So the hash will match the hardcoded hash and the validation in the contract will pass and the transaction will succeed and will create a new QuestionPaper state.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Ashish Sinha\n                \n                Jan 22, 2020 at 17:49\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Validating that the file is correct is one step, but what's the purpose of the file? Read step number 3 from my initial answer; you read the contents of the file (the blacklist) and you make sure that the issuer of your state is not on that list. You must also have the issuer as a required signer on the Create command of your QuestionPaper inside the contract; this way the Student node can't set the issuer to School, because if it does; then the School will become a required signer as per your contract, and obviously the School node will reject signing a state it didn't issue.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Adel Rustum\n                \n                Jan 22, 2020 at 20:31\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                So to summarize, your state should have an issuer attribute, your contract should validate that the issuer is a required signer, your flow should add an attachment, your contract will first validate that this is the correct file, second it will validate that the issuer is not on the blacklist.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Adel Rustum\n                \n                Jan 22, 2020 at 20:32\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","473":"I just want to get some data from another contract without changing anything on that contract.

The commonly used and de-facto standard implementation OpenSSH, for the latter case, uses a file for each user on the server, normally located under the user's home directory as $HOME\/.ssh\/authorized_keys, which lists the publickeys valid for that user. If the client process specifies a username and a publickey listed in that user's authorized_keys file, and uses the privatekey to sign certain data including a connection secret and nonces, that is considered to prove the identity of the user. (See RFC 4252 for details, but start with 4253 for context.) Other implementations need to have equivalent data, although not necessarily that exact file. The host\/server usually allows the user\/client to make several attempts, in case it has multiple keys and\/or other methods to try, but this is configurable.\nSSH by itself mostly doesn't control access; it just establishes the user\/client's identity as a username configured on the 'host'. Using that identity to control access -- what security people call authorization as opposed to identification and authentication -- depends on the host. Many SSH hosts are Unix, and for Unix the same rules apply to accessing Unix over SSH as apply to other kinds of connection: this starts with the classic 'chmod bits' on each file allowing read,write,execute to user,group,other, and can include other things like ACLs, SELinux attributes, sudo rules, group match for signalling processes, special configuration of some things like NFS, and so on and so on. If the SSH host\/server is NOT Unix, what security rules or policies it applies once you have connected and authenticated it are up to it and may be quite different.\nOpenSSH (on a Unix host) also implements a few options in the authorized_keys file that impose additional restrictions on what the client can do (over that connection); see man sshd on your system or here under AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT. In addition, as noted there, OpenSSH supports a level of indirection: instead of directly listing every key in each applicable user's authorized_keys file you can use a (designated) 'CA' key to sign other keys, and then configure authorized_keys to accept any key signed by a listed CA key. These certificates can themselves include some restrictions; see man ssh-keygen under CERTIFICATES.

There is no central authority that acts as an arbitrator or monitor. As a distributed log of records, there is greater transparency \u00e2\u0080\u0093 making fraud and manipulation more difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it is more complicated to hack the system.\nAll of this could well be familiar because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s written about the features of blockchain as well.\nBlockchain:\nBlockchain is nothing else but a DLT with a specific set of features. It is also a shared database \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a log of records \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but in this case shared by means of blocks that, as the name indicates, form a chain. The blocks are closed by a type of cryptographic signature called a \u00e2\u0080\u0098hash\u00e2\u0080\u0099; the next block begins with that same \u00e2\u0080\u0098hash\u00e2\u0080\u0099, a kind of wax seal. That is how it is verified that the encrypted information has not been manipulated and that it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be manipulated.\n\nDLT platforms that are not blockchain provide immutability too, but it's just the way Hyperledger Fabric provides this characteristic which makes it a blockchain framework.\nEvery blockchain framework, be it the Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc all store the transaction information in blocks, where each block is linked to its predecessor by a hash and provides immutability.\nCorda is very much similar to Hyperledger Fabric, but it is said to be both a blockchain and not a blockchain. Architecturally, it's very much similar to Hyperleder Fabric, but with only a key difference which makes Hyperledger Fabric a blockchain framework, and Corda a DLT.\nI'll try to answer your question by emphasizing on the point that why Corda is not a blockchain.\nWhy is Corda a blockchain, and not a blockchain?\n\nA Transaction in Corda is cryptographically linked (chained) to the transactions it depends on. Just like Bitcoin, but the range of concepts that can be expressed is far wider.\n\nTransactions in Corda are processed by having each participant in the transaction execute the same code deterministically to verify the proposed updates to the ledger. Just like Ethereum, but the languages you can use are high-level and productive, like Java, rather than obscure ones like Solidity.\n\nTransactions in Corda are shared only with those who have a need to know. Just like channels in Fabric but designed in from day one and fully integrated into the programming model.\n\nTransactions in Corda are confirmed through a process of consensus forming using one of a range of algorithms, including Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithms. Just like any other blockchain, but with the unique features that a Corda network can support multiple different consensus pools using different algorithms.\n\n\nSo, for all intents and purposes, Corda is a blockchain. And yet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an utterly critical difference.\nUnlike the platforms mentioned above, Corda does not periodically batch up transactions needing confirmation\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008ainto a block\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aand confirm them in one go. Instead, Corda confirms each transaction in real-time. No need to wait for a bunch of other transactions to come along. No need to wait for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblock interval\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Each transaction is confirmed as we go.\nNow coming onto your question why Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) uses blockchain structure?

First of all, you create a public\/private key pair. A public\/private key pair is the result of some complicated mathematics. What you can do with these keys is interesting. You can sign a message with your private key. If your friend has your public key, they can verify that the signature is valid for that message, which means that they can verify that it was you writing that message.\nIn blockchain, an address is the sha256 hash of a public key.\nNow when it is time to transfer your money, you need to do two things:\n\nShow that you are the owner of that address. You do that by providing the public key. The miners in this case can hash your public key to verify that it results in the 'from' address.\nConfirm that you own the private key. You do that by creating the signature of the transaction data.\n\nIf a miner changes the 'to' address, the 'from' address, or the amount, the signature of the transaction data isn't valid anymore.\nIf a miner decides to add a new signature based on the changed data, it won't verify anymore with the public key in the transaction.\nIf the miner decides to change both the signature and the public so they match, then the 'from' address won't be correct anymore as it is the hash of the public key.\nI left out some details like:\n\nA 'from' address refers to a previous transaction\nThe amount in the previous transaction needs to be spend completely. So if there is too much in there, you will have a second 'to' address which is in your control, basically transferring the rest back to yourself\nThere can be many 'from' addresses and 'to' addresses in one transaction. Each 'from' address requires a public key and signature.\nThe transaction actually contains a script that says how to verify the addresses and signatures. If you expand the language used in that script, then you are talking about a smart contract.\nThere are private keys which can generate multiple public keys, and therefore multiple address, so you don't have to manage multiple private keys.\nThere is no way to verify if a 'to' address is valid. So you can transfer money to an address where nobody has the private key for.\n\nYou can find the complicated details of what goes into a transaction here: https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Transaction","190":"Based off your second image it doesn't look like your 1 Org Local Fabric started properly in the first place (you have no gateways and for some reason your wallets aren't grouped together!).\nIf you teardown your 1 Org Local Fabric then start it again hopefully it'll work.","191":null,"192":null,"193":"The application creates and discards a buffer on every iteration of the loop.

A member here can be any member apart from the admin. It can be a peer, client, user. If you want it to be signed by an admin, you'll have to specify explicitly in role object with value admin for the property name.\nFor your case, I think the following structure will be apt.\n{\n  identities: [\n    { role: { name: \"member\", mspId: \"peerOrg1\" }},\n    { role: { name: \"admin\", mspId: \"peerOrg1\" }},\n    { role: { name: \"member\", mspId: \"peerOrg2\" }},\n    { role: { name: \"admin\", mspId: \"peerOrg2\" }}\n  ],\n  policy: {\n    \"2-of\": [\n      { \"1-of\": [{ \"signed-by\": 0 }, { \"signed-by\": 1 }]}\n      { \"1-of\": [{ \"signed-by\": 2 }, { \"signed-by\": 3 }]}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nSadly, I couldn't find more examples of endorsement-policies in node-sdk but I think above examples would do the job in explaining its working.\nAlso, I think this will help you in a better understanding of what members and admins are in an endorsement policy.","195":"Have you tried GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor inside your chaincode directory?\nIf the above solution didn't work then you can follow this answer.","196":"All of these async functions are running on the same thread.

You can use the \u00e2\u0080\u0093channel-config-policyflag to select a channel policy with format used by the channel configuration and by ACLs.\n\n\nsee here\n\nEverytime you brought a new org to your network, you will need to update the channel config.

Most ML applications are Data Science related, which is taking an enormous role in the enterprise space. \n\nIf you have any questions, I might be able to answer regarding those 2 topics.

Your question to which address did 1ADSb1ZZ9k3NsDf3JTQCQ4mb8bthiAN6NJ pay doesn't make sense because it, along with 3 other addresses paid out to 2 different addresses. In this case, it is usually one address received 1 amount and the second address received change (back to the original owner). To understand what I mean, I'll explain how a transaction is created on Bitcoin.\n\nScenario\n\nUser A wants to send .1 BTC to user B. In order to do that, they must gather up enough previous transaction outputs (where they received Bitcoin) and use them as inputs to the new transaction. So, let's say last week user C sent .05 BTC to user A, and user D sent .1 BTC to user A. You might think user A can just grab the output from user D's transaction and send that to B, but you must include a small fee for the miner in order to get your transaction added to the a block in the blockchain (miners will almost never mine a transaction for free, they get paid the transaction fee, as well as the block reward when they mine a block).\n\nSo, in order to cover the fee, let's say it's 0.00003 BTC. User A needs to use both previous outputs so there will be a total of 0.15 BTC sent. Now, you have to spend all of the input, so user A would obviously not want to send that much if they only owe 0.1 BTC so user A will create a transaction which sends 0.1BTC to user A, and 0.04997 BTC (0.05 minus the transaction fee) back to themselves. This is called the change address, and usually is not the same as any address user A has previously used. This is for privacy reasons, so it is harder to tell who received the Bitcoin, and who got the change back if someone was trying to track users spending.","497":"3500 transactions per second means that on average, 3500 transactions were created by some clients and then appeared in some next newly created block within one second. \n\nIt can be that several blocks were created in that second. \n\nYou can't use Fabric, or any other consensus mechanism that uses IP networks for a real time application, simply because that if the network transmission can be delayed for more than 100ms.\n\nYou can, however - make the consensus service in Fabric use low batch timeouts (say, of 10ms) and then blocks would be formed on a frequent basis and you'll have a transaction latency less than 100ms on average.","498":"A Blockchain transaction can be defined as a small unit of task that is stored in public records.

Transaction is used when we wish to modify or update the state stored in the Ethereum network.\n\nA smart contract is a software program that adds layers of information onto digital transactions being executed on a blockchain. It allows for more complex transactions than simply exchanging digital tokens for a product or service. In other words, it's exactly what it sounds like: a contract, or an agreement between parties involved in a transaction that holds each party responsible (buyer vs. seller, for example) for their role. \n\nContract is the \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart contract\u00e2\u0080\u009d capability in Ethereum network, where the business logic is implemented.

After that you need to collect all endorsements from peers and have to make signed envelope. To send a signed envelope to orderers you need to broadcast your envelope to orderers with Send gRPC call where we need to create a AtomicBroadcastClient.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Ta-seen Junaid\n                \n                Sep 9, 2020 at 22:29,Hyperledger Fabric Java SDK, Go SDK etc etc works as  gRPC clients, you can build your client by following those examples, test cases on those repository.

As bytes are read from memory 32 at a time and the hex value you pass is less than that and the automatically padded zeros at the right bits make it a huge value. Instead provide a bytes value which is 32 bytes long and has integer value on the right most bits. Like so, 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c6bf52634000.

In the end, both peers have the same data (if both joined to the same channels). So just perform both computations in the same peer.

Its execution must be reproducible. The transaction result should only depend on the previous state and the input parameters. If your chaincode depends on the specific peer it is being executed on, then it is not deterministic or reproducible. Your approach goes against Fabric's (or blockchain's) principles.

Your key is different from your tx ID, so your tx ID is not saved on the state, only in the block chain. Thus, forget about getState, it has no sense.
