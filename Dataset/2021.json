The transaction has a charge (gas) that my server needs to pay in order to send the transaction, but I wanna \"transfer\" this charge to the user who intends to create the token. I was wondering if there is any way to my server send this transaction \"on behalf of someone else\" and the transaction charge be payed by this address? Maybe sign the transaction on client-side and send it on server-side (I need to pay here again right)?","144":"I'm trying to figure out how to send an NFT and display it on a website.

Looking also into the application database layer with blocks, it seems that block reverting isn't normally possible with arbitrary depth. Does that mean it's impossible to have probabilistic finality in substrate?\nContext to the problem:\nIn Bitcoin, Ethereum and other probabilistic-finality-based chains, the chain can reorg with as many blocks as the system needs. It can even be thousands of blocks if need be. Consequently, the state transition function (using substrate terminology) must be reversible. Hence, when a reorg happens, blocks are reverted in a way where (in bitcoin), outputs are removed and inputs become unspent in the UTXO set.\nIn the most abstract form, this can be functionally represented as:\nApply(StateA, blockX)  -> StateB\n\nRevert(StateB, blockX) -> StateA\n\nThis strictly requires that it's known how a revert is done, given a block. In bitcoin, this is easily achievable as we know exactly how to \"unspend\" inputs and delete outputs by a simple database change.\nThe current situation in substrate (as far as I understand it):\nBut in a general purpose chain like substrate, this cannot be done without storing the set of state changes per block over the whole <blockchain>, which has a huge diskspace\/memory requirement (called archive-pruning mode in substrate). Or, the developer has to provide the mechanism for reversibility, which doesn't seem to be a requirement in the pallet standard interface, as people are only required to provide the changes that have to be done in the database only when applying a block, not when removing\/reverting a block from the tip of the mainchain.\nAs can be seen in the database handling of a block, it's not possible to revert an arbitrary number of blocks the same way it's possible in probabilistic finality <blockchain>s (unless pruning mode is archive, which is impractical to assume for all users). Substrate seems to assume that finality is an inevitability, where in the technical underlying database\/storage, the concept of \"canonicalization\" is defined. A canonicalized block is a block that's technically irrevertible\/irreversible, because its state transaction function has been applied to the database. And given that pallets don't define any mechanism for reverting extrinsics\/<transactions> and hence blocks, there's absolutely no way to revert a block after it gets canonicalized. So, substrate stores a tree of all possible block candidates that are not yet canonicalized\/finalized.\nThis caused me lots of confusion because it seems that substrate does support proof-of-work consensus, but the canonicalization concept completely eradicates the possibility to revert blocks, which is typically a requirement in proof of work due to its probabilistic nature. (and on a humorous note, congratulations, 51% attacks with shadow mining are not possible anymore :-), but on a serious note, spontaneous contentious forks and chain-splits are possible if a group of honest nodes get isolated long enough, which is not that unrealistic, e.g., if a country decides to block the internet for a few days or block the node ports for political reasons, which should never be a problem in normal proof-of-work systems).\nThe question\nThis question is based on the requirement of building a substrate-based <blockchain> that follows bitcoin.\nIs it possible to make substrate consensus completely operate with correct probabilistic finality (without canonicalization and with proper definitions of reversible operations)? What would have to be changed? Is it a realistic change or is it drilled to the bones such that it's practically impossible? I honestly don't know where to start and would like to get an overview of the changes that have to be done to make the substrate <blockchain> work with probabilistic finality.","147":"I'm trying to edit the file ORG1MSPanchors.tx, so I've executed the following commands:\n-> configtxlator proto_decode --input .\/channel-artifacts\/ORG1MSPanchors.tx --type common.Envelope >channel-artifacts\/ORG1MSPanchors.json\n-> nano channel-artifacts\/ORG1MSPanchors.json\n-> configtxlator proto_encode --input .\/channel-artifacts\/ORG1MSPanchors.json --type common.Envelope >.\/channel-artifacts\/ORG1MSPanchors.tx\n\nBut the changes are not made in ORG1MSPanchors.tx.

For more information about compiling std and no_std features, see XXX.\n\nThis is fine, I'm familiar with std and no_std. My impression is that you either have std enabled and compile to native Rust binary, or you don't and compile to WASM binary.\nBut then, when I check out the runtime's lib.rs, I find the following:\n#![cfg_attr(not(feature = \"std\"), no_std)]\n\/\/ `construct_runtime!` does a lot of recursion and requires us to increase the limit to 256.\n#![recursion_limit = \"256\"]\n\n\/\/ Make the WASM binary available.\n#[cfg(feature = \"std\")]\ninclude!(concat!(env!(\"OUT_DIR\"), \"\/wasm_binary.rs\"));\n\n\/\/ ...\n\nThis confuses me: Why is the WASM binary \"made available\" when std is enabled? I would have expected the opposite. And what exactly does \"made available\" mean in this context?\nI dug a little deeper and found the following in an older version of the tutorial, which goes a little more into detail, causing even more grievous mental confusion:\n\nThis is important to enable the Substrate runtime to compile to both native binaries (which support Rust std) and Wasm binaries (which do not: no_std).\n\n(Again, this is fine, although I'm not sure what they mean by \"support\".) And then later, refering to the file whose first lines I've posted above:\n\nYou can see that at the top of the file, we define that we will use no_std when we are not using the std feature. A few lines lower you can see #[cfg(feature = \"std\")] above the wasm_binary.rs import, which is a flag saying to only import the WASM binary when we have enabled the std feature.\n\nWhat?!\nSo, if std is enabled, then we use the Rust std library and WASM? And when std is not enabled, then we only use libcore? This seems to completely contradict the earlier statements.\nI am absolutely certain that all of this is the result of a seriously stupid mistake on my part, but I can't figure it out.\nEdit.

Then, whenever you want to perform computation on the Dapp (like changing a variable or executing a function that changes a certain parameter of the Smart Contract), you send a Contract Transaction to the Ethereum network which routes it to the appropriate Node, and alongside with that, you send some Ether.\nA volunteer on the Ethereum network lends their computing power to add that Contract Transaction to the Ethereum <blockchain>, \"like mining\", and receives the ether you sent as a reward for completing the task. This is much like how Bitcoin mining works, except, in this case, the miners lend their hardware to perform computing tasks for your Dapp.\nSo what is ultimately happening is, you change data on your Dapp by adding entries into the <blockchain> itself, every time you call a function that changes a variable\/data inside the Smart Contract instance?

I learned that Ethereum <blockchain> works on Kademlia. The distributed hash table and its working was beautiful and nicely explained by Eleuth P2P.\nNow I used <geth> to connect to the Ethereum Mainnet and it discovered 2 to 3 maximum peers in 5 to 6 minutes.\nNow I know the algorithm but my concern is how the first peer is discovered? Because internet is just a big set of routers and different type of computers (server, computer, etc ) and if you broadcast the discovery like in ARP. The internet will be flooded with these peer discovery broadcast messages and this doesn't seems right. So how initially the connections are made? Also we cannot trust a single network for first time connection because this will make the system server and client based and not decentralised so how the initial connections and peer discovery happens?\nAre the broadcast message like have TTL like to prevent the circular loop like in TCP I guess?

I would prefer to do it in NodeJs.\nThis question is related to deployment of smart contracts on Ethereum and Polygon network. I am able to deploy using command line interface truffle commands. For example truffle migrate --network matic. How do I run these commands through code?\nDo I need to use chile_proces.exec function to execute the truffle commands? Or is there a different way that devs are already doing it?","313":"I saw that Deterministic is one of the property of Hashing. So can we predict the data on which we performed hasing algo by checking the hash output value?\nEg. If me and my friend uses the same hashign algo on our individual data. And at some point we both got ABCD as hash output value. So in that We can get to know on each other on which data we are performing hashing, right?","314":"I was doing some research over the weekend on some <blockchain> dev in the Solana <blockchain> and came across a construct called Compact-u16.  The definition of this in the documentation says the following: \"A compact-u16 is a multi-byte encoding of 16 bits. The first byte contains the lower 7 bits of the value in its lower 7 bits. If the value is above 0x7f, the high bit is set and the next 7 bits of the value are placed into the lower 7 bits of a second byte. If the value is above 0x3fff, the high bit is set and the remaining 2 bits of the value are placed into the lower 2 bits of a third byte.\".\nI have been coding for 30+ years.  Maybe I'm just old school on this, but why is there a construct to store 16 bits of data in 3 bytes?  This is just vastly inefficient from my standpoint.  Is there a reason for this?  On further research, I found a doc related to assembly instruction pointers, which referenced 7 instruction pointers that are useful for caching values when context switching in and out of the processor stack.  But this construct is used for a web app platform.  Like, literally, there is no reason that I have been able to find that justifies using 3 bytes to store 16 bits of data.  If the developers wanted to use an elegant bit mapping solution to compress space, why not just use a semaphore?  Why create a brand new construct that increases the storage requirements for the data by 33%.\nWhat am I missing?","315":"We've deployed a smart contract on ethereum <blockchain>.

Firstly, i produced the first code, my thinking behind this is that it checks the latest_block every 0.1 seconds, in turn running thorough the if statements, and if the latest_block is either of the 4 defined variables, it will run the function \"run_wallets\". However, from trialling it, it works correctly for the first block which it encounters (the three_before variable) and then stops checking the statements once it has found one 'True' statement.\nstarting_block = 10079310\none_before = 10079309\ntwo_before = 10079308\nthree_before = 10079307\n\n\ndef update():\n    while True:\n\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n        latest_block = <web3>.eth.blockNumber\n        print(latest_block)\n\n        if latest_block == three_before:\n            run_wallets()\n\n        elif latest_block == two_before:\n            run_wallets()\n\n        elif latest_block == one_before:\n            run_wallets()\n\n        elif latest_block == starting_block:\n            run_wallets()\n\nupdate()\n\nThis is understandable as the loop will stop once it has a 'true' statement. I therefore tried to create a list, and make a loop that will keep running until the list is empty. So this time, once the first IF statement was true, it would remove the variable from the list so that it is no longer in the list, and therefore will run the wallets on the other 3 blocks until the list is empty.

I'm trying to understand the scope of the require statement across multiple contracts. I want to design a master contract that a user can set an allowance for that then interacts with several other subcontracts that costs a custom ERC20 token to interact with. The idea is that the user only needs to authorize the master contract that manages their tokens and makes sure that they are transferred to the other contracts for payment when interacted with it, rather than have to get the user to set an allowance for all the other contracts individually.\nSay for example we have two contracts, contract A is the master (in this scenario the user has already set the correct allowance), and contract B, the contract that the user wants to interact with. The user calls the function in contract A which checks that they have the required amount of tokens to use the function in b before execution. if everything checks out on the finance side, contract A calls the function in contract B which also needs to check certain variables to proceed.  Providing everything checks out, B adds the user to a mapping and returns, then A executes the transferfrom function.  (I hope this all makes sense);\nCould the user change the allowance to zero at some point during call_b's execution in a way that passed the first two require statements but fails when transferfrom executes and if that did happen would a require fail in A revert the storage changes made in B as a result?\nor\nthe other option I have considered is transferring the user's tokes immediately after passing the financial checks and relying on the require statement around  B.f(msg.sender)  to revert the transfer if it fails.

I want to make a data entry function, which collects the text in a STRING and a BYTES10 variable that collects the position of the text. You must store the text neatly so that you can access it later. And you should be able to enter new text without replacing the old one. Then an output function that returns the text and the coordinates, all those entered into the network since the beginning of the contract. And a function that allows you to delete data, in case any is entered wrong.

The information that I find in blogs and other help about this topic, apparently is quite outdated in terms of the compiler version and tends to give me problems. I imagine that I have to do a mapping, but I have not found the way yet. I appreciate any help you can give me to move me forward on this.

This is a new\n#   concept as of v1.1.0 and should not be utilized in mixed networks with\n#   v1.0.x peers and orderers.  Capabilities define features which must be\n#   present in a fabric binary for that binary to safely participate in the\n#   fabric network.  For instance, if a new MSP type is added, newer binaries\n#   might recognize and validate the signatures from this type, while older\n#   binaries without this support would be unable to validate those\n#   transactions.  This could lead to different versions of the fabric binaries\n#   having different world states.

Can someone help me?\n\nI have found the reason for this problem. That's because endorsers got from channel should be contained in the peers list which got by discovery, or it will be filtered.\nAnd there has always been only one endorser peer got from channel or discovery. So, unless the two are equal, the endorsement is not satisfied. As a result, it may take several retries to succeed, or an error will be returned when the channel.policies.discovery.retryOpts.attempts or channel.policies.discovery.retryOpts.maxBackoff is reached.\nNow the question is, why can only one endorser be obtained from the channel or found by discovery?

Or can anyone out there on IPFS do that as well?\nIf they can, is there a way to prevent that from happening?\n=======================================\nUPDATED QUESTION:\nMy specific use-case has to do with updating the metadata of ERC721 Tokens - after  they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already been minted.\nImagine for example a game where certain objects - like say a magical sword - gains special powers after a certain amount of usage or after the completion of certain missions by its owner. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want to update this sword\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributes by editing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Metadata and re-committing this updated metadata file to the <blockchain>.\nIf our game has 100 swords for example, and we initially uploaded to IPFS a folder containing all 100 json files (one for each sword), then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure IPFS still let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you access the specific files within the hashed-folder by their specific human-readable names (and not only by their hash.)\nSo if our sword happens to be sword #76, and our naming convention for our JSON files was of this format: \u00e2\u0080\u009csword000.json\u00e2\u0080\u009d , then sword#76\u00e2\u0080\u0099s JSON metadata file would have a path such as:\nhttp:\/\/ipfs.infura.io\/QmY2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\/sword076.json\nIf we then edited the \u00e2\u0080\u009csword076.json\u00e2\u0080\u009c file and drag-n-dropped it back into our master JSON folder, it would obviously cause that folder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hash\/CID value to change. BUT, as long as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able update our Solidity Contract\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ctokenURI\u00e2\u0080\u009d method to look for and serve our \u00e2\u0080\u009c.json\u00e2\u0080\u009d files from this newly updated HASH\/CID folder name, we could still refer to the individual files within it by their regular English names. Which means we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be good to go.\nWhether or not this is a good scheme to employ is something we can definitely discuss, but I FIRST want to go back to my original question\/concern, which is that I want to make sure that WE are the ONLY ones that can update the contents of our folder - and that no one else has permission to do that.\nDoes that make sense?","726":"I know it is important for <blockchain> to constantly checking whether the previous blocks have been altered or not but I don't know why does <blockchain> needs hash difficulty like zeros at the beginning of the hash value. From my perspective, since the previous blocks cannot be altered, if a database can memorize all the hash value of the previous blocks, once identify a change in those values, we can know which block has been altered due to a cyber attack(maybe). How is hash difficulty playing an important role here, is it necessary to use the method of constantly checking previous blocks' beginning sub string?

Also, I tried inserting five-second pauses between the calls to returnAndIncrement() in an attempt to break any existing races, but there was no effect on the results.\nMy second thought was that there was something fundamental wrong with the configuration of my test, so that I was just getting zeros back regardless of what was actually happening. So I started the currentValue at 100 instead of 0, as you see above; that's not the issue.\nMy third thought was that when I think I'm copying the value of currentValue into value, what I'm actually doing is making value a reference to the value of currentValue, so that when I increment currentValue I'm also incrementing value.

But I'm very noobish in this whole crypto world, and I'm terribly fascinated about its technology.\nSo just for education purposes I've decided to build my own <blockchain> following more or less the bitcoin principles (ECC keypair generation using the secpbk1 curve, SHA256 as hashing algo, dynamic diff based on the timestamp of the previous block, p2p connectivity etc..). But I've came to a point where I'm pretty confused about the <blockchain>'s wallet itself.\nFor what I've learned so far, each transaction has to be signed by a wallet. So my <transactions> has basically three fields: input, outputs and id. Since the user's wallet signs the outputs field of the transaction, this can't be changed anymore without being signed again by the same private key that belongs to the public key contained in the input field, how can I reward the miners?\nIf I got it right, the miner creates a transaction signed somehow by the chain using the fee in the outputs field, or by asking the chain itself to generate and sign a special reward transaction for that miner.\nThe guide that I was following was using the second approach, and was generating a <blockchain> wallet each time the program was executed on a client. This approach left me perplexed:\nwouldn't a client generate a new wallet for \"his\" <blockchain> each time it goes back online? If so, wouldn't this create a mess on the <transactions> signed on the chain? Since each miner (therefore peer) signing its own reward would use a different <blockchain> wallet than the other peers? Wouldn't this lead to any problems?\nThe first one that I might think of, is that if we generate a new <blockchain> wallet that signs rewards for miners, each peer would create a different wallet, so wouldn't this lead to many \"ghosts\" wallets in the chain, that spits out rewards tokens from nowhere? Is this supposed to happen?\nFor what I think is definitively more straightforward to use the fee amount to reward the miner, but this doesn't solve my doubts at all. Since the outputs of the <transactions> are signed upon creation, how could the peer initiating the transaction know upfront the possible miner who finds the block? And if he can't know it, how could possibly the miner \"extract\" its reward without tampering the transaction itself? Of course it could create a new transaction, and add that to the block. But who would sign that transaction? From where those reward tokens come?\nAnd if the answer is not to generate a new wallet each time, where could you possibly store that very first private key of the chain's wallet where no one can see it, but still be able to use it, without having to put a server in the middle?\nWhich in my opinion breaks the whole decentralized concept and would add a single point of failure.\nI've also implemented a <transactions> pool, that automatically filters out invalid (tampered) <transactions>, whenever a miner requests a sub set of them to stamp in a block. But does this mean that the miner for that only exception can tamper the transaction since it'll be \"forged\" in the block? So who gives a *** if it was tampered once it got in the chain? MEEEEEH that doesn't sound nice at all.\nI'm terribly confused, and I'm dreaming key pairs at night.

The IPs that I am using for the pods are the ClusterIPs of the peer and orderer pods. Also the certificates I am using are not Fabric generated certs, the certs have been created and signed using the CA of our organization and thus the crypto folder has a \"tlsintermediatecerts\" folder inside it. I have tried using the pem file from inside the \"tlsca\" folder and also the pem file from inside the \"tlsintermediatecerts\" folder for the tlsca path in the connection.json. But none have worked.\nHere is the directory structure of the crypto folder.\nAlso I have verified the certs by making curl requests to each of the peers and orderers and checked that the handshake completes.\nC:.\n\u00e2\u0094\u009c\u00e2\u0094\u0080\u00e2\u0094\u0080\u00e2\u0094\u0080peers.org1.com\n\u00e2\u0094\u0082

The reason it fails as far as I can see is that the compressed public key I am passing to the function bitcoin.pubkey_to_address() is one digit too short. As it is one of the most famous bitcoin libraries I assume that there is a fundamental error in my understanding. Thus, the question: what am I doing wrong in computing the compressed bitcoin address from a private key?\nI have installed the following library: pip3 install bitcoin in the minimal example below, I am using <python> 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04.\nimport bitcoin\n\n\nclass WalletWithBalance:\n    def __init__(self, _private_key: str):\n        self.private_key_uncompressed_hex: str = _private_key\n\n        # public keys:\n        self.public_key_uncompressed_as_x_y_tuple_hex = self.get_private_key_as_x_y_tuple()\n        self.public_key_compressed_hex = self.get_compressed_public_key_hex()\n\n        # addresses:\n        self.address_compressed = bitcoin.pubkey_to_address(self.public_key_compressed_hex)\n\n    def get_public_key_as_raw_hex_str(self):\n        public_key_as_raw_hex_str = bitcoin.encode_pubkey(self.public_key_uncompressed_as_x_y_tuple_hex, 'hex')\n        return public_key_as_raw_hex_str\n\n    def get_private_key_as_x_y_tuple(self):\n        private_key_raw_decimal_number = bitcoin.decode_privkey(self.private_key_uncompressed_hex, 'hex')\n        return bitcoin.fast_multiply(bitcoin.G, private_key_raw_decimal_number)\n\n    def get_compressed_public_key_hex(self):\n        (public_key_x, public_key_y) = self.public_key_uncompressed_as_x_y_tuple_hex\n        return self.get_compressed_prefix(public_key_y) + bitcoin.encode(public_key_x, 16)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_compressed_prefix(public_key_y):\n        if public_key_y % 2 == 0:\n            return \"02\"\n        else:\n            return \"03\"\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    wallet = WalletWithBalance(_private_key=\"0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c\")\n\nThe stacktrace reads:\n\/usr\/bin\/<python>3 \/foo\/minimal_example.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\/foo\/minimal_example.py\", line 36, in <module>\n    wallet = WalletWithBalance(_private_key=\"0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c\")\n  File \"\/foo\/minimal_example.py\", line 13, in __init__\n    self.address_compressed = bitcoin.pubkey_to_address(self.public_key_compressed_hex)\n  File \"\/DoeJohn\/.local\/lib\/<python>3.8\/site-packages\/bitcoin\/main.py\", line 452, in pubkey_to_address\n    return bin_to_b58check(bin_hash160(pubkey), magicbyte)\n  File \"\/DoeJohn\/.local\/lib\/<python>3.8\/site-packages\/bitcoin\/main.py\", line 334, in bin_hash160\n    intermed = hashlib.sha256(string).digest()\nTypeError: Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing","808":"I just started learning about <hyperledger> Fabric, and I was wondering is there any way to apply business logic to the endorsement and transaction commitment process?\nFor example, if the endorsement policy is set to AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member') could I somehow define what logic does the Org1.member execute to sign a transaction as valid?\nAnd could that logic be based on some State object value?

However, since our backend also needs to \"know\" the result, the player can, of course, change the result on his end, and send the wrong result.\nIf, on the other hand, we have our backend call the function on smart contract, there should be a way to prove to the player that we really called the smart contract and that we called it just once.

It's about different actors agreeing with each other. Any actor is free to include timestamps and <transactions> in the hash, but how do you know which actor has <transactions> and timestamps everybody agrees on that happened? In <blockchain>s with POW you can be certain that the chosen timestamp and <transactions> are agreed upon, because of the work done by the network. To spend money again differently you first have to also do the POW. To reverse the question: how would you circumvent the double spending problem by putting timestamps in a hash?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0user2609980\n                \n                Dec 14, 2021 at 20:12\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Please edit the question to limit it to a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Community\nBot                \n                Dec 21, 2021 at 10:46\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","44":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","45":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","46":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","47":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","48":"Just happened to me yet again!

In addition to building your dapp and attracting users, you also need to incentivise people to run your parachain nodes. Presumably, you'll want to interact with users from other chains so you'll need to make use of XCMP (Cross Chain Messaging Protocol).

That's one of the pros of substrate, it is open for customization and within that customization enters how production and finalization works for your case. So, the easy answer here would be yes why not as long as you want to implement it if its not yet done. And on the other side you will have to check the requirements for your case to see if moving away of the current implementation is something feasible, in case you want to.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Alejandro Mart\u00c3\u00adnez\n                \n                Nov 18, 2021 at 17:32\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @AlejandroMart\u00c3\u00adnez It seems that there's huge confusion that people mix finalization and canonicalization.

The article is a little sloppy in that spot. The mathematics is tad bit more complicated, and in truth there is no guarantee that you can ever recover the actual input A from H(A) because there may be two (or more!) values A1 and A2 such that H(A1) = H(A2). However, for most applications of hash functions, any input that hashes to the same value is good enough to break the system. And for <blockchain> applications, the input may very well be 128 bits (or 256 bits for SHA256).\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0President James K.

I have figured out a way to deal with this. The problem was the data was being saved correctly but when fetching the records solidity was assigning msg.sender to the creator of the contract not the one who sent the transaction. So, in order to deal with this I am sending the user address from frontend in the call function and receiving the address as a parameter in the respective functions. So instead of using the msg.sender I am using the address that I am receiving from frontend.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Usama\n                \n                Oct 12, 2021 at 4:22\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","282":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","283":"1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                HDFS already calculates availability.... 1 - (Space used\/Total space ) %\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0OneCricketeer\n                \n                Oct 6, 2021 at 19:35\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Can we use the same equation to calculate the availability of ipfs?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Asrul Paelori Ahmad\n                \n                Oct 8, 2021 at 2:36\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Never used it, but 1-usage\/capacity is a global formula for calculating storage availability\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0OneCricketeer\n                \n                Oct 8, 2021 at 13:13\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","284":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","285":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","286":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","287":"Your uint256 internal randomResult; is internal, can you make it public?

That makes sense.  Part of the error above is \"JSONDecodeError(\"Expecting value\", s, err.value) from None\", which I guess it's erroring out when there is no value returned, but runs normally if something is returned.

How can it be that the nodes don't share the same number of finished <transactions>?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0lucgerrits\n                \n                Jun 15, 2021 at 8:44\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Are all nodes block producers (authorities in AuRa)? It is possible that <transactions> are being validated and then not included in blocks as they are not gossiped to the block producer. I would expect your load balancing being opaque to what node is targeted might make this difficult to assess directly.

Still have one doubt regarding getting the status from an API after the contract is signed between all the parties. I need to know whether the party A, B and C all have signed the transaction or not.  Lets say Party A is signed then the status should be 'Proposed', if PartyA and PartyB both have signed then the status should be 'Pending' and if all three party has signed then the status should change to 'Approved' And theses status should be fetched from an API.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0user3930728\n                \n                May 24, 2021 at 12:31\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @user3930728  I updated my answer after these new details given in your comment.

Presenting the input as hex-encoded bytes is common, as is base64 encoding. If you've an online sha256 tool that accepts hex-encoded input then you can use that. If you have a text string then you must decide how to convert that to bytes. Modern standards specify UTF-8. If you can find an online tool that accepts text characters and returns hex-encoded UTF-8 output then that's what you can provide as input to the SHA256 tool.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0President James K.

However, your JS snippet returns the transaction object, not the Solidity return value, so it's not possible to verify using the data that you've shared... I'd recommend debugging the ERC contract's transfer() function on your local chain, whether and why it returns false. (Possibly the sender doesn't have enough tokens?)\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Petr Hejda\n                \n                Apr 13, 2021 at 21:11\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","714":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","715":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","716":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","717":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","718":"Did you run npm install truffle-plugin-verify ?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Patrick Collins\n                \n                Apr 10, 2021 at 17:34\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                yep, is already installed.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0unos_mopsus\n                \n                Apr 10, 2021 at 17:49\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Did you deploy the contract?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Patrick Collins\n                \n                Apr 10, 2021 at 17:53\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Did you read the entire post?

Alright, so this project is basicly what i want to try from a guy who uploaded it on github, and it has no discription in it on how to run it. Here's the link : github.com\/hardik22317\/<blockchain>-based_E-Voting What i want to do is test it out. I would like to ask u if u have like a few minutes to check it out and actually run the app and u will conclude what i'm telling, once u want to Cast a Vote, it just doesn't work.

Anyway, I'll surely do that try at a later time so that I will be able to reply to you with an answer and to contact API developers.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Emisilve86\n                \n                Feb 7, 2021 at 13:19\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                If you made all params exactly according to REST API doc then definitely there is a bug either in their documentation or API code implementation.

And now the issue is they have created the peer link like peer0.org1.<blockchain>.com and when I am running this in kubernetes I can not mention this dns name in manifest because of this \". dot\" I need to use \" hyphen -\" in the dns and we have TLS certificate on that I am getting an error. So if you have any idea how will I do this in kubernetes do let me know\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0shubham kamboj\n                \n                Feb 6, 2021 at 12:05\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","820":"Likely the transaction was not accepted to the network.

I am not familiar with their source code, but I would say that the timestamp is not always recomputed, as this would mean making a system call for each attempt to solve the Proof of Work puzzle, making the algorithm slower.\nA similar remark is valid for your general case. You can recompute the timestamp, but you don't have to. This will not affect your probability of solving the puzzle. If you do recompute it, the algorithm will be slower, but the block will have a timestamp that is more accurate (to its exact mining time).\nUPDATE:\nI was unable to locate the exact place in the Bitcoin code base, but I am now certain that the timestamp does not change each time, since it would be a pretty meaningless operation that would just slow down the search for solution to the mining puzzle. The timestamps of blocks in the <blockchain> are not required to be in the strictly increasing order. This is due to the fact that the network is distributed throughout the world, and there is no designated time zone which is to be used for timestamps.\nBasically, a timestamp just needs to be \"not too old\", or if you want it more precisely: \"a timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours\".

Ie whenever the Chainlink Labs team deploys new versions of the aggregator, they update the proxy contract to set the current aggregator version to be the new one, and all new price data starts getting written to the new aggregator.\nBased on this, if you want historical price data for a proxy contract\/price pair from the last couple weeks or so, you'd need to go to the current aggregator for the proxy contract, then get the current round info (including timestamp), then go back in aggregator rounds in a loop until you get to a round that is less than your search parameter timestamp.\nTo find the current aggregator contract address for a proxy contract, you can call the aggregator getter function in the proxy contract.\nThe phase ID can be thought of as an incrementing ID number that the proxy contract uses to identify each aggregator as it gets added to the proxy, so the first one is 1, second is 2 etc. To find out what the current phase ID is of the current aggregator, you can use the phaseId getter function in the proxy contract.\nAggregator round IDs start from 1 and increase by 1 each time. Eg you can  use the aggregator latestRound getter function to find the last round that it stored, and then start from that number as an input parameter to getRoundData, and then reduce the number by one and loop through until you reach your point in time.\nUnlike Aggregator round IDs, proxy round IDs are those big really long numbers like 36893488147419113293, and are actually just a derived value based on the aggregator phase ID and the aggregator round ID. This is done to ensure the proxy round IDs are always increasing in value, and that there will never be any overlap between the same rounds across different aggregators, eg round 5000 from aggregator with phase ID 1 should have a lower proxy round ID that round 5000 from aggregator with phase ID 2\nIn Solidity you can easily replicate the proxy round ID derived value with the following formula, passing in the phase ID of the aggregator and the aggregator round ID\nreturn uint80(uint256(_phaseId) << 64 | _aggregatorRoundId);\n\nYou can even then take that derived value and pass it into the proxy contract getRoundData function, and get the same data result as calling getRoundData in the aggregator contract for the given aggregator round ID.\nI find A good way to play around with these is to interact with the functions directly on etherescan, and see the data returned. Ie here's the Kovan ETH\/USD proxy and its latest aggregator\nRegarding the answer your second question, the best way is to start from 'now', ie get the latest aggregator, grab the latest round in the aggregator and then go back in time by reducing the aggregator round ID by 1, and continue to get pricing info until the round timestamp is < your search timestamp.\nFinally, looping in Solidity is not very gas efficient. Another approach you can take is to off-load the external computation to an oracle, and the oracle can give you the correct round ID, and you can then take that and verify the results on-chain. Here's an example of that design pattern in the form of an external adapter that retrieves historical price data based on a timestamp. There is a live version of this running on Kovan too, check out the readme for more info","34":"Yes, by using configtxlator binary that's included.

Both RSK and Ethereum have difficulty adjustment functions that try to maintain a target density of blocks (including trunk and ommers). In other words, a fixed number of blocks mined per time period. The adjustment functions in RSK and Ethereum are not equal, but both target a block density, not an inter-block time in the chain. Therefore, if the mining network produces a higher number of ommer blocks, the number of trunk blocks created over a period decreases, and the trunk average inter-block time increases. In the case of Ethereum, the number of ommers have oscillated between 5% and 40% in the last 5 years, but in the last 2 years it has stayed relatively stable between 4% and 8%. This translates to a +-2% error when measuring time based on block count. However, in Ethereum the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdifficulty bomb\u00e2\u0080\u009d has affected the average block time much more than the ommer rate. The average block time is ~14 seconds now, but it has peaked to 30, 20 and 17 seconds at different times. Therefore, in Ethereum, the a number of blocks should not be used to measure long periods of time. It may be used only for short periods, not longer than a month. More importantly, if Ethereum switches to PoS, the average block interval will decrease to 12 seconds at that point.\nHere we show the Ethereum ommer rate:\n\n(source: https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/ethereum_uncle_rate)\nAnd this is Ethereum average block time:\n\n(source: https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/ethereum_average_block_time)\nThe spikes are caused by the difficulty bomb and the abrupt decays by hard-forks that delayed the bomb.\nIn RSK, most miners are configured to minimize mining pool bandwidth and create a high number of ommers. This is permitted and encouraged by design. They can also be configured to minimize the number of ommers, and consume more bandwidth. RSK targets approximately a density of 2 blocks every 33 seconds, and currently one block is an ommer, and the other is part of the trunk. If the RSK\/Bitcoin miners decide in the future to switch to the ommer-minimizing mode, almost no ommers will be created and the average trunk block interval will decrease to 16.5 seconds (to keep the 2 blocks per 33 seconds invariant). This is why, even if the trunk block interval in RSK is currently very stable, in the future (and without prior notice) it can suddenly change from 22 seconds down to 16.5 seconds. This makes the block number an unreliable source for computing the time for values such as the interest rate.\nOn the other hand, the block time cannot be easily forged because nodes check that block time is not in the future, and not prior to the parent block time. Also RSK has a consensus rule that ties RSK timestamp to Bitcoin timestamp, which makes cheating extremely expensive as the Bitcoin blocks back-dated or forward-dated produced by merge-mining would be invalid.\nHere is the RSK average block time and average uncle rate from June 2018 to March 2021. The X-axis shows the block number.\n\nEach dot in the chart corresponds to a day. We can see that the block interval is highly correlated to the uncle rate.\nThe EVM opcode NUMBER (which is used to obtain the block height) returns the number of trunk blocks, not considering ommers. As a consequence, the value returned cannot be used to count all types of blocks. However, a new opcode OMMERCOUNT could be added, to query the total number of ommers referenced up to the current block. To<geth>er with NUMBER, these opcodes could be used to better approximate the passage of time.","125":"I hope you were able to solve the problem.\nIf not, entryCount needs to be converted to uint224 before being left shifted.\nOtherwise, it's like shifting a 4 bit number 4 times or more.\n1101 << 4:\n1010\n0100\n1000\n0000\n\nAs you can see all the info is lost after shifting 4 times.

All we would need to do is go back through the <blockchain>'s history and check that rental ownership has been transferred to Bob at some point, which in this case it has. The <blockchain> is the database. Anyone who has had their names previously written down on the <blockchain> may leave a review.\nEDIT\nTo answer your question in the comments, how do we know that the transaction Alice transfers ownership to Landlord is true? Well, this transaction is considered valid if we can verify that Alice was the one to submit it. But how does this work?\nAlice would have been given a private key and a public key when setting up an address for the <blockchain>.

There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signing function that looks like this:\nSign(transaction, private key) = Signature\n\nGiven a transaction, Alice can use her private key to \u00e2\u0080\u009csign it\u00e2\u0080\u009d and produce a signature that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sent to the miner. When the miner gets this transaction along with the signature, they can verify using a second function:\nVerify(transaction, Signature, public key) = True\/False\n\nUsing this function, the miner can verify if the transaction WAS in fact made with the private key associated with the public key. If it was, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a valid transaction and can be added to the <blockchain>.\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the math behind these functions because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite complicated, so unfortunately I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain in detail here.\nI recommend watching 3Blue1Brown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video on Bitcoin, which goes over digital signing.

Whether or not a metadata is considered in\nsecond sale or not is determined by the primary_sale_happened boolean\non the Metadata account.\n\nMy interpretation of this is that the expected behavior should be for the initial sale to get divided between creators using the ratios defined by each creator's share. Sounds like you're experiencing something different.\nKeep in mind that this documentation is for the parent project. Candy-machine-mint seems to be a fork and they may have altered some of that behavior.","212":"I would make sure you did pip install <web3> in the terminal\n\nOnce you've installed <web3> I would do cmd + shift + p and search for Reload Window\nVS Code\n\n\n...

There is an old scheme known as P2PK where the public key is part of the output script but this is almost never used today in favour of P2PKH, P2WPKH and soon P2TR.\nAs for communicating the required information to create a transaction, an address is used to encode the hash of the public key or script with different output script variations using different encoding variations to indicate what output script should be used.\nHere are some of the encoding schemes for common locking scripts:\n\nP2PKH uses Base58 check encoding where the encoded data consists of a version prefix of 0x00 for mainnet followed by the Hash160 of the receiving public key. This results in an address starting with the character 1.\nP2SH uses Base58 check encoding where the encoded data consists of a version prefix of 0x05 for mainnet  followed by the Hash160 of the redeem script. This results in an address starting with the character 3.\nP2WPKH uses Bech32 encoding where the encoded data consists of a witness version followed by the Hash160 of the public key. The witness version for segwit outputs is 0 and results in the address starting with bc1q.\nP2WSH uses Bech32 encoding where the encoded data consists of a witness version followed by the SHA256 of the script. Because P2WSH uses SHA256 as opposed to Hash160, the address is longer than P2WPKH addresses. The address also starts with bc1q.\nP2TR uses Bech32m encoding where the encoded data consists of the witness version followed by the tweaked key unhashed. The witness version here is 1 and results in the address bc1p.\n\n\nIf your question is regarding the actual transmission of Person B's address to Person A, there is no official method to do this. However if you want to check if an address received is valid, the checksum at the end of each encoded address can be used. For addresses encoded in Base58, the checksum is the last 4 characters and for Bech32 it is the last 6 characters.

Mostly nodes have dedicated some space for mempool. Now nodes pick up transaction from mempool (prioritising the one's with higher fee as they get to keep the fee) and add it in a block. This block is called \"candidate block\".\nNodes start minning candidate block and if they are lucky enough to mine it first the block is broadcasted to the whole network and everyone adds this block to their chain and start minning next block repeating the same process as above.\nThe Above process is mainly for bitcoin <blockchain> but other <blockchain> all of similar processes.\nFor beginners instead of going through articles and youtube videos i would recommend studying these books to develop a thorough understanding of underlying architecture.

There the Chainlink node initiates various subscriptions, which are a special feature of the websocket protocol to enable bidirectional communication. More precisely, this means that the Chainlink node is informed if a certain \"state\" of the subscription changes. Basically, the node interacts with using JSON-RPC methods and uses the following methods to initiate and process various functions internally:\neth_getBlockByNumber,eth_getBalance,eth_getTransactionReceipt,eth_getTransactionCount,eth_getLogs,eth_subscribe,eth_unsubscribe,eth_sendRawTransaction and eth_Call\nhttps:\/\/ethereum.org\/uk\/developers\/docs\/apis\/json-rpc\/\nThe high amount of interactions of the Chainlink node are especially executed during the syncing process via the internal HeadTracker service. This service initiates a \"head\" subscription in order to interact with every single incoming new blockheader.\nDuring this syncing process it uses the JSON-RPC methods eth_GetBlockByNumber and eth_getBalance to get all the necessary information from the block. So these two methods are used\/ executed every block. The number of requests now depends on the average blocktime of the network the Chainlink node is connected to\nAn example would be the Kovan Testnet:\nThe avg. blocktime here is 6.7sec, which means you get a daily request number of approx. 21.000\nDuring fulfilling job requests, those request also includes following methods: eth_getTransactionReceipt, eth_sendRawTransaction, eth_getLogs, eth_subscribe, eth_unsubscribe, eth_getTransactionCount and eth_call, which increases the total number significantly depending on the number of job requests.\nIt should also be noted that especially with faster <blockchain>s (e.g. polygon) there is a very high payload of the WebSocket and you have to deal with a good full node connection in detail, as many full nodes do not receive such a high number of requests permanently.","516":"IBC-Solidity, the IBC implementations in Solidity, enables EVM-compatible <blockchain>s, including <hyperledger> Besu, to be interoperable via Cosmos IBC.\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/<hyperledger>-labs\/yui-ibc-solidity\nIBC Solidity is one of the components of YUI, a <hyperledger> Lab, that archives interoperability with multiple heterogeneous <blockchain>s through Cosmos IBC.","517":"Yep!

OpenZeppelin has a very good article that explains this pattern.\nIn a nutshell: Your user-facing contract does not have any functionality except for a proxy to some implementation, and a function to change the proxy settings from an authorized address. When you need to upgrade, you just deploy the newer implementation to a different address and reflect the new address in the proxy. Because of how delegatecall works, it uses storage of your proxy contract. The values that you have stored, stay the same when you start using new implementation contract.\n\n\nCan I deploy a new contract that only has the time lock function that interacts with my already deployed contract and lock some tokens of the already deployed contract ?\n\nThis wouldn't work if you tried to lock existing tokens. The original contract would have no way to call the new contract to check whether it's allowed to transfer the tokens - or whether they're locked.\nBut if you have a mint feature in the original contract, you could mint new tokens that would belong to the lock contract. The lock contract would allow some authorized users to spend the tokens it owns - only after some time passes (i.e. timelock).","623":"Goerli Etherscan has a different API host.\nYou need to use https:\/\/api-goerli.etherscan.io\/ instead of https:\/\/api.etherscan.io\/\nSource: https:\/\/goerli.etherscan.io\/apis#accounts","624":null,"625":null,"626":"You can use a payable function modifier.

The inputs for compilation are source code and few other values (such as optimizer settings)... The outputs include the ABI JSON and bytecode... So you don't really need to deploy the contract to get the json, just compile it (without deployment).\nIt's not possible to get ABI JSON purely from a bytecode (or an address that contains just the bytecode).\n\nIf the contract has source code published, you can compile the source code to get the ABI JSON.\nIf if doesn't have the source code published, it's also possible that the contract implements some standard (e.g. ERC-20). If you know whether and what standard it implements, you can use a general ABI JSON that reflects on this standard (e.g. this is ABI JSON of a ERC-20 standard). However, it does not reflect any functions that the contract might have used to extend the standard-defined minimum.","630":"The ERC-721 standard does not define a \"best\" or \"correct\" way to mint new tokens (such as whether it should be open or restricted) and it's up to each contract developer to implement or omit the minting feature in a way that reflects their needs.\n\nCreating of NFTs (\"minting\") and destruction NFTs (\"burning\") is not included in the specification. Your contract may implement these by other means. Please see the event documentation for your responsibilities when creating or destroying NFTs.\n\nBut having a whitelist of addresses that are authorized to mint new tokens (e.g. MINTER_ROLE or onlyOwner) seems to be more common than allowing anyone to freely mint new tokens.\n\nEven though it's theoretically possible to deploy new contract each time a new token is minted, it's not a standard approach (and I personally haven't seen any contract that does it). In most cases the minting process \"just\" creates a new ID, stores a new string\/URL value associated with the ID, associates this new token with an owner address (of the token, not a contract owner), plus updates some metadata such as amount of tokens owned by an address (see example below).\nThe token owner can then transfer their tokens, give anyone control over their tokens, and do other stuff depending on the contract implementation.\nThe mappings that you point out in your question (_owners and _balances) suggest that they store token owner (not contract owner) addresses as well as amount of tokens held by each address.\nExample:\n\nContract owner mints token ID 1 to address 0x123.\n\nValue of _owners[1] is 0x123 (was 0, the default value)\n\nValue of _balances[0x123] becomes 1 (was 0, the default value)\n\n\n\nContract owner mints token ID 2 to address 0x123.\n\nValue of _owners[1] is still 0x123\n\nValue of _owners[2] is now 0x123 (was 0, the default value)\n\nValue of _balances[0x123] becomes 2 (because they now own 2 tokens)","631":null,"632":"You should stop your node then you can use the tools provided by Tron, e.g:\n\njava -jar LiteFullNodeTool.jar -o split -t snapshot --fn-data-path\noutput-directory\/database --dataset-path\nliteDatabase\/output-directory\/\n\nYou can also refer to this issue about this subject for more information.\nHope it was helpful.","633":"Bytecode of a smart contract is published in a transaction (that is mined in a block), and then stored in a storage of the network (usually Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain) associated with an address.\nSo each time when you're interacting with a smart contract, you're interacting with an address that is associated with a storage chunk containing the bytecode. Plus the bytecode points to other storage slots where the values of its variables are stored.\nAll state changes (including changes of the storage values) are part of the ledger database. The raw <blockchain> data only contain the state changes (not the current state), but most higher layers return the current state by default (you can still chose to fetch an older state, e.g. the \"defaultBlock\" param here).

It can also have a variable containing the funding goal.

A CA is reactive only (A CA account actions will always be the result of an EOA action).\nA CA account cannot send a public transaction like an EOA would as it cannot sight it with a public key since it doesn't have one.\nIn Ethereum there is this notion of account state.\nBasically a mapping from addresses (EOA and CA) to a specific state.\nThe state of a specific account contains information's such as the balance and the nonce (number of <transactions> \/ contracts that this account created) and for CA this is expanded with code hash and storage hash.\n<transactions>\nA transaction can be:\n\nsmart contract creation\na value\/data transfer from account A to account B.\n\nSmart contract creation :\nThis transaction has no specific receiving address.\nIt includes data containing the smart contract code in the 'data' field.\nThe <blockchain> state will be updated to account for the new smart contract as long as this transaction is included in a block and consensus is reached.\nAn EOA address will be deterministically given to your smart contract (see this thread for an explanation on how it is done) and a new mapping is added in the account state for your smart contract containing the contract's code. You can now send transfer <transactions> to your smart contract address.\nValue\/Data transfer from account A to account B.\nNow let's say you want to call the method \"setName\" of your smart contract.\nYou or anyone can send a transaction from your account address (A) to the smart contract address (B) with the relevant information in the 'data' field (which method to call, parameters, etc..)\nThe execution itself will take place in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) where your contracts code will be interpreted and any change to the account states will be recorded.\nWith all of that in mind I suppose the answer to your questions will be clearer :\nBut how the computer program is getting executed?\nIt is executed inside the EVM on nodes. This execution will find it's origin in an EOA transaction calling the smart contract. The result of the execution is the changes to the account states.\nhow <transactions> are getting validated?\nSmart contracts cannot issue <transactions> as they are referenced as CA accounts. The original EOA transaction creating or calling the smart contract is validated as any other transaction and submitted to the normal consensus scheme of the <blockchain>.\nThe confusion might come from the fact that a smart contract can send funds to another address (EOA or CA), but they don't do so in the form of a public transaction.\nThis is possible because smart contracts are deterministic, therefore if you have the <blockchain> you have all the smart contract creation and smart contract calls in the form of <transactions> in the <blockchain>, and executing a smart contract in the EVM can change the account state. so if you send funds from (account A - EOA) to (account B - CA) that forwards them to (account C - EOA or CA) inside the EVM during its execution, it is recorded and replayable as everything is deterministic.\nSo if a smart contracts does something illegal ( spending more than its balance ) the original transaction that triggered it is invalid.\nhow consensus achieved?\nThere is no explicit consensus for smart contracts actions, it only directly concern blocks and <transactions>.\nWhile the whole answer is quite Ethereum specific, I hope it gives you a better idea of the integration of smart contracts in a <blockchain> system.","648":"The error is caused by a typo in your code.\nIt's supposed to be uint (unsigned integer) - not unit.","649":"Your createProduct method returns nothing.

So in a sense, nobody can modify it, not even you, because it's immutable. I believe this confusion can be resolved with more background on how IPFS works.\nWhen you add things to IPFS each file is hashed, and given a CID. The same is true for directories, but their CID can more easily be understood as a sum of the contents of the directory. So if any files in the directory are updated, added, or deleted, the directory gets a new CID.\nUnderstanding this, if someone else added the exact same content in the exact same way, they'd end up with the exact same CID! With this, if two people added the same CID, and a third person requested that file (or directory), both nodes would be able to serve the data, as we know it's exactly the same. The same is true if you simply shared your CID and another node pinned it, both nodes would have the same data, so if anyone requested it, both nodes would be able to serve it.\nSo your local copy, cannot be edited by anyone. In a sense, if you're relying on the IPFS CID as the address of your data, not even by you! This is why IPFS is typically referred to as \"immutable\", because any data you request via an IPFS CID will always be the same. If you change any of the data, you'll get a new CID.\nMore info can be found here: Content Addressing & Immutability\nIf you read all this and thought \"well what if I want mutable data?\", I'd recommend looking into IPNS and possibly ipfs-sync if you're looking for a tool to automatically update IPNS for you.","726":"\"Memorizing\" the hashes of previous blocks is not workable, because a new node must be able to start from scratch (with no memory) and validate the previous blocks on its own.  It should not have to \"trust\" other nodes.  That is a major design goal of <blockchain>.\nThe hash difficulty is necessary to limit the speed at which new blocks can be created worldwide (for example one new block worldwide every 10 minutes).  If they could be created very quickly then a malicious node could create an incorrect (but valid looking) chain that is the longest of any other node's. The rule is that the longest chain is accepted.\nEDIT:\nJust to expand... <blockchain> design anticipates that occasionally a small number (say, 1 or 2) of malicious blocks could be added to the \"longest\" chain and would be accepted as valid temporarily. It is expected that the non-malicious majority of hashing power worldwide will eventually come up with an even longer chain that discards the malicious block(s) (performing a co-called \"<blockchain> rewrite\").\nThat is why it is recommended to wait for a certain number of blocks to be added (so-called \"confirmations\", e.g. 6) before accepting a new block as correct (because it is extremely unlikely to ever be rewritten at that point). It's also why the so-called \"51%\" attack (meaning the majority of worldwide hashing power is conspiring malliciously) is a vulnerability.","727":null,"728":"If you can provide some log file to demonstrate your use case would be better.\nSend & Receive is typically a one-direction communication, one sends and one receives.

But if you know what you're doing, you could keep the storage with more low-level approach.\n\nBy running truffle migrate you are usually running a javascript code that deploys the Solidity contract using the standard CREATE EVM opcode. So every time you're running truffle migrate, Truffle deploys the contract to a new address that has empty storage slots.\nEven though it's possible to redeploy a smart contract to an already used address using CREATE2 opcode (and to keep the original storage data), Truffle currently doesn't support this option.\nNote: The --reset option only runs all migrations from the beginning in case of previous failure, but has no effect on the storage or the contract address.\n\nYou could achieve this goal (keeping the storage) by setting the (contract deployment) transaction data to an instruction to deploy to an address that already contains a self-destruct contract.

It has got two netwrok types. Checkout about being 'free' in there, as there are two network types that you can create.\nUser management is a subject in HLF, where each organization can have its own MSP (membership service provider). HLF offers CA (certificate authority) server where crypto material is generated by this server which later would be used to connect to the network. So user management basically becomes cert management. I'm not sure about IBM managed HLF, but Amazon managed <blockchain> as of date (AMB HLF 1.4, but latest HLF is 2.3 as of date) does not have UI driver user permissioning, you'll have to monkey around with commands and stuff, but once you get hold of how to do it, it would be simple scripting for user management.\nThe best way for network creation is to first spin off the test network that HLF has given in its website https:\/\/<hyperledger>-fabric.readthedocs.io\/en\/release-2.3\/test_network.html Mind you it is not a simple 'hello world' program that you see in NodeJS or Java, but it is going to be a full blown implementaion that you are getting into even with the sample that is given in their website. For a completely novice user, this itself can take days to get it working.\nOnce you get this network to work, you'll have docker desktop running on your machine which has various containers running in it once the HLF network is UP. One of them is going to be CouchDB, this would hold the ledger data (HLF world state), so you can use browser based UI to access this CouchDB to see what all data got put into ledger. All this if you have spun up HLF on your local machine by going through all that documentation, but if you use AMB, there is no UI to 'see' what all ledger data got created in it (as of date), for this you'll have to write your own API in chain code that queries and returns data for you.\nAlso, I find it highly awkward that each concept is illustrated in 3 languages - Node, Go, TypeScript. Although Java is also support, there almost is no mention of Java implementation in their website (as of date) in their regular 'theory' that they explain.\nSo, for HLF you'll have to not just fix on the version of HLF you want to use, but also fix on the programming language you want to write your chaincodes and HLF client code in.","744":"You need to add the contract address to your Metamask instance.\n\nIn the account detail, click on \"Add token\"\n\n\nPaste the conctract address to the address field in the \"Custom token\" tab\n\n\nReview the data, click \"Next\", and you you can see the token balance in your wallet.","745":"How to calculate the data field size\n(when you're sending a transaction calling a smart contract function)\nThe data field value could be divided into three parts:\n\n0x\n4 bytes (8 hex characters) - This is the function signature, it identifies the function that you are going to call.\n\nThe value is first 4 bytes of keccak256 hash of the function name and argument types.

If so, wouldn't this create a mess on the <transactions> signed on the chain? Since each miner (therefore peer) signing its own reward would use a different <blockchain> wallet than the other peers? Wouldn't this lead to any problems?\n\nYou don't say what problems you think this will lead to. I can't think of any.\n\nFor what I think is definitively more straightforward to use the fee amount to reward the miner, but this doesn't solve my doubts at all. Since the outputs of the <transactions> are signed upon creation, how could the peer initiating the transaction know upfront the possible miner who finds the block? And if he can't know it, how could possibly the miner \"extract\" its reward without tampering the transaction itself?\n\nThe simplest solution to this is for the transaction itself to just contain its inputs and outputs. The fee is the difference between the total inputs and the total outputs.\nThe miner just includes the transaction in the block of <transactions> they mine. They also add one additional transaction into the block, sending themselves the reward. Obviously, they know their own destination address. Every participant who receives the newly-mined block checks to make sure this transaction is valid (just as they check every other one) and doesn't claim a larger reward than is allowed.\n\nAnd if the answer is not to generate a new wallet each time, where could you possibly store that very first private key of the chain's wallet where no one can see it, but still be able to use it, without having to put a server in the middle?\n\nTypically in a file on the local disk. The private key isn't really needed anyway -- you only need it to send. You don't need it to mine or report. So it can be prompted for or decrypted only when actually needed.\n\nOf course it could create a new transaction, and add that to the block. But who would sign that transaction? From where those reward tokens come?\n\nThe usual rule is that the reward transaction has no inputs, one output, and no signature. The tokens come from the pool of unclaimed miner reward tokens which can be finite or infinite depending on the <blockchain>'s design.

The backend has a hot wallet with ETH balance to be able to create and broadcast <transactions>.\nThe transaction is pushed to Ethereum API node over JSON-RPC. The node broadcasters the transaction to P2P network. A miner picks up the transaction from the mempool. A new block is created. The miner broadcasts the newly crated block back to the peer-to-peer network. Your Ethereum node picks up the new block. <web3>.js backend application polls or subscribes events related to the smart contracts from your Ethereum node. Backend event <web3>.js handlers are fired for the state changes in the new block.\nNote that the blocks can be also rolled back in the case of a minor <blockchain> reorganisation. In the case or reorganisation, the event handlers fire again (twice, thrice, etc.) for each competing block. Minor <blockchain> reorganisation may occur many times in an hour. The current state is probabilistic, so you always need to wait for a few blocks to be sure.\nFor events and <transactions> by other actors in the <blockchain>, you just subscribe to the events and process them as new blocks arrive from miners to your node.","852":"Though <blockchain> is immutable, it does not mean the current state can not be updated. Each Ethereum block is a new state that consists of account balances and smart contract variables. The current state is the last valid block which your Ethereum node sees. History cannot be altered, but the current state can be altered with <transactions>.\nAs the question is overly broad and over basic <blockchain> concepts, I suggest taking classes in Ethereum smart contract development first.","853":"Is there a way to convince the player that we really called the smart contract and that we called it just once?\n\nThe player can sign a message in their wallet and then your server calls the smart contract with this message. The smart contract decrypts the message and acts based on it. The transaction is pushed to the network by your server and the server has a hot wallet that covers ETH cost.\nAlternatively, you can use a layer 2 network like Optimism where transaction costs are cheaper. You can also use Gas Station Network with relayers to make the user pay in a token instead of Ether.","854":"10 minutes is not accurate, but the average time to generate a block.

For the public Ethereum, this, firstly, violates the very concept of equality of nodes in the network, and secondly, when trying to expand the pool of validators to a comparable number of nodes participating in the public Ethereum, it will inevitably lead to the collapse of the consensus process.\nTherefore, in the public Ethereum, PoW is used, which does not imply the presence of \"special\" nodes and any explicit confirmations - the consensus is based on the fact that following the general rules: finding a \"lucky\" hash and adding a new block to the longest fork, the node has the highest probability of receiving block creation rewards.","860":"What you need is a hierarchially deterministic address generation from a single seed.

Its value is the amount of seconds (or milliseconds in some cases) since January 1st, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. Many programming languages have a way to convert a human readable date to the timestamp (unfortunately, Solidity currently can do that only on a very limited basis - only from a relative expression such as \"now + 1 year\", but not from an absolute date such as \"2021-12-31\").

I'm not that familiar with the Ethers.js library, maybe they're actively polling the requests over HTTPS (asking each X seconds for an update), and the WSS malfunction might be related to something else... Generally, WSS keeps an open connection allowing for constant flow of messages both ways - while during HTTPS connection your app acts as a client sending separate requests to the server, but a server can't send a message to a client without the client's prior request...

Unfortunately, this is a wrong answer and targets the wrong issue. Yes, you can nominally build PoW in Substrate. I've explained actually in my question that this is nominally possible and provided a link to the pallet that allows that. That's not correct PoW though. Being able to work to produce blocks isn't the only condition required to have a correct PoW chain. As it stands, there's no way to do long reorgs due to canonicalization, which creates the problems I mentioned in the question (possible chainsplits, winner isn't really the longest chain, etc).\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0The Quantum Physicist\n                \n                Dec 14, 2021 at 4:51\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Have a look at historical sessions in the session pallet.

This clears some things up, but I'm not 100% clear on this.  So the idea is that build.rs builds the Wasm binary of lib.rs with std not enabled. And if std is enabled, then the native binary is built with the Wasm binary embedded, correct?  But what if std is not enabled? Then build.rs is still executed and builds the Wasm binary, right? But isn't then a no_std native binary built (which doesn't have the Wasm binary embedded), as well?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0mkl\n                \n                Nov 11, 2021 at 18:41\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    2\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                As far as I can tell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extremely rare to build the runtime in no_std mode directly. The no_std build is usually only initiated from build.rs. However if you have to do so, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely the runtime will be still built ti the wasm target, but then it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be embedded to the outer build because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not std.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0h4x3rotab\n                \n                Nov 14, 2021 at 18:46\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Thank you!

Actually, I'm trying to setup multiple nodes (for different type of data, not for crypto prices) with their respective oracles and then setup aggregator which will aggregate results just like chianlink is doing for prices.  So first of all, is it the right strategy to create feed like setup for other type of information?

If this is or a hackathon (or just to demo your app) and there's no existing data feed for the data you need, I'd suggest using the \"AnyAPI\" feature and a single Chainlink node. Once it's time to go to mainnet, the Chainlink Labs team can assist you in making a decentralized oracle network.

A call to an async function without await returns a promise and moves on to the next line while the promise is still pending. If you instead put await in front of the async function, Javascript will keep doing something else until the promise resolves a value. Only then javascript will assign the resolved value to priceFetcher and move to the next line.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Marcello Del Buono\n                \n                Oct 25, 2021 at 18:43\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","230":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","231":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","232":"You needn't delete localhost 8545.

So kind of like if the DEX was publishing an API, and the source contract was calling the API.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Petr Hejda\n                \n                Oct 24, 2021 at 20:04\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","255":"2\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Thanks, Vlad, for your explanations \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008d\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Soulwish\n                \n                Oct 16, 2021 at 9:59\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","256":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","257":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","258":"thank you @Petr for the answer. so you say that <blockchain> will overwrite the existing data with new data. is this not breaking the rule that data in <blockchain> cant be removed\/erased?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0alvin Christianto\n                \n                Oct 16, 2021 at 11:00\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                The data is not removed from the <blockchain> - you can still access it using an archive node.

The miner must find such a nonce, that the resulting hash will have 19 leading zeros. This is pure luck, due to the \"quality\" of the SHA-256 algorithm. First of all, there is a mathematical proof, that if you take SHA-256 hash with 19 leading zero, you can't calculate or at least approximate the original value and the nonce. As an example, imagine that the hacker stole the database with SHA-256 password hashes.

Both miners and the hackers might need months to \"guess\" the correct nonce or original password. You would need to spend such a large amount of CPU energy that the operation of \"guessing\" the password or mining the bitcoin becomes very expensive for one miner and for one hacker. Of course, if 1 million hackers would unite and would try to guess your original password from SHA-256 hash at the same time, one of them would eventually succeed. The same is true for miners.

Try deleting the compiled WASM file and recompile it using this command: docs.near.org\/docs\/develop\/contracts\/rust\/\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  If that doesn't work try deploying your contract to a different accountId and if that doesn't work let's jump on a call and tackle this in real-time. :)\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Josh Ford\n                \n                Sep 3, 2021 at 1:54\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Thanks! i will follow the same process  on another computer... lets see.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0josedlujan\n                \n                Sep 3, 2021 at 2:49\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                I follow the same tutorial and use the same commands on another computer and everything its fine... i will try to find the problem.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0josedlujan\n                \n                Sep 3, 2021 at 16:48\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    \n                \u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\n            Show 1 more comment","397":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","398":"Thank You soo much @Petr,   Now just more curious to know which one will be better to use ?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Trimantra Software Solution\n                \n                Sep 1, 2021 at 9:58\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @TrimantraSoftwareSolution It depends on your use case... First of all, it's discouraged here at StackOverflow to ask\/answer opinion-based questions and answers, because it tends to bring heated arguments and flamewars sometimes... Apart from that, PoA can be better for one thing, PoW can be better for other. So it really does depend and I'm not able to answer without more context.... But my personal opinion in this situation is that unless you need a specific consensus algorithm, I'd go with the default one (which is PoW) simply because there might be more documentation and support available.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Petr Hejda\n                \n                Sep 1, 2021 at 10:13\n                        \n                            \n                        \n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","399":null,"400":"Have you got an idea of the number of request\/mn allowed by the API ?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Jerem Lachkar\n                \n                Jan 10, 2022 at 16:01\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @JeremLachkar From my experience, it changes regularly and isn't especially clear from their SDK.

You can also further check by importing the first account of ganache in Metamask. Just get the private key of the first account from ganache-cli console and paste it in Metamask. Make sure that correct balance is also shown in Metamask after account is created. Its even better if you run ganache-cli with a mnemonic with a -m \"string\" flag. In that way the same accounts will be created from the mnemonic to use the same account in Metamask\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Taimoor\n                \n                Aug 13, 2021 at 14:02\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                And yes.

About the ABI and Contract Address part. this needs to be valid. I am passing the ABI in the same way like yours after reading from JSON file. This seems ok since it needs a JSON interface for ABI. For address part, I entered it manually like this \"0xD90d46Ae7427933760A52FE06Ba13C443A4E720C\" after deploying the contract. And i believe this is where you are having the issue.

So there really shouldn't be any communication issues as they are all likely local docker images and all that works out of the box for everything local. But you can ping the servers, try telnet, etc. If the network is external to the JDK machine, then ip address instead of 'localhost' or similar may be the issue. If external, firewalls and such can interfere. telnet servername port should get you a telnet console if all tcp\/ip communication is available. I'd turn debug on for the peer, also.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0jworthington\n                \n                Aug 2, 2021 at 0:27\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","478":null,"479":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","480":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","481":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","482":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","483":"Okay, but still having error of same like \"Data location must be \"memory\" or \"calldata\" for return parameter in function, but none was given.\"\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Neel gorasiya\n                \n                Jul 30, 2021 at 14:36\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @Neelgorasiya Can you post a screenshot of your error and code?.

In the example above, the key is the token ID, and the value is the token price.

You can get their list by connecting to the known list of peers and recursively getting addresses of their known peers, and their known peers...

So you understand when the file is updated, the dir CID changes, you update that in Solidity, great. So wouldn't the question be more \"who can update the tokenuri method?\" as anyone could download your IPFS files, change them, and upload them with a new CID, as IPFS is completely open. However your tokenuri method I'm assuming has permission involved, and that's really the content that's being pointed to. So the real problem to address is \"Who can update the TokenURI?\" and if that's just you, sounds like you're all set.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Discordian\n                \n                Apr 10, 2021 at 16:15\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                @Discoradian Thanks for responding again. To answer your question: \"wouldn't the question be more 'who can update the tokenuri method?'\" The answer is \"No. My question is and remains what it always was, the gist of it being: can anyone update any directory on IPFS?\"   The reason I updated my original question was to provide you with further context re why I asked my original question, but I never changed my original question.

But if a computer is not able to communicate on the port (and there are no backup ways such as a secondary port in the network definition), it would not be able to connect and use the network.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Petr Hejda\n                \n                Mar 30, 2021 at 8:03\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                alright I think I get it. so what about IP addresses ? did we need some nodes with static IP addresses 24\/7 online ? like a server ? and in other nodes we have list of that main nodes that their IP addresses never changes ?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0rouzbehsbz\n                \n                Mar 30, 2021 at 9:02\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                    1\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                The static IPs are not needed - your app can always wait for other nodes to broadcast their presence.

Since Solidity 0.8, the validation whether the amount is available, is done automatically through the underflow\/overflow check.

I thought about this option of splitting everything into different contracts, but it seemed like it might be a headache.

So I strongly discourage that... I'm not that familiar with the NFTs practical examples that much, so I don't know any examples, but I'm sure if you DYOR, you'll find examples. My answer is based on observing and writing implementations of ERC-20, where you also don't see many contracts defining 2+ tokens (even for the practical reasons that Etherscan and other <blockchain> explorers would not recognize 2+ tokens in the same contract).\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Petr Hejda\n                \n                Feb 20, 2021 at 1:13\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                OK got it. Makes sense. And yes, when I said \"not allowed\" I did mean that you certainly could change method signatures if you wanted to - but then you'd no longer be conformant to the ERC721 standards.  I will continue researching this - and hopefully others will chime in with their advice as it could be useful to others.

The example referred in this medium post is hardcoding the private key, which is big red no no.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0luk\n                \n                Oct 24, 2022 at 16:43\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","815":"Thank you for the feedback, do you think it is something that can be implemented in an existing <blockchain> schema or would it require a full rebuild from the ground up?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0dralexhunter\n                \n                Feb 7, 2021 at 22:59\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","816":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","817":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","818":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","819":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","820":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","821":null,"822":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","823":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","824":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","825":"I don't understand, but its work i think.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Ixar\n                \n                Feb 8, 2021 at 21:48\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","826":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","827":"Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","828":"I get what you mean but it can create confusion if someone only find out the discrepancy issue after sometime when they try to retrieve that record from 4 peers.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Calvin Cheng\n                \n                Feb 2, 2021 at 1:51\n            \n        \n    \n\n            \n\t    \n\n        \n                    Add a comment\n                \u00c2\u00a0|","829":"with this '$.\"017989w06d3f902f1f362dfg48f862dba6a605229e99859a91d854f93ac13894\".transaction.size'  unfortunately return null !!\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0mohammadjavadkh\n                \n                Jan 31, 2021 at 7:39\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                Are you sure that's an exact match on that key?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Charlieface\n                \n                Jan 31, 2021 at 7:40\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                excuse me. your answer is correct.

The first step is to send a transaction to the smart contract with the customer id and other parameters such as the city where to make the reservation. After collecting this data through an oracle, the smart contract compares the data, determines if a reservation is valid and saves 'id, true' or 'id, false'. My question is: where is this data ('id, true' or 'id, false') saved?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Mario Roma\n                \n                Jan 21, 2021 at 10:22\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                My second question is: periodically, the oracle sends updated weather data to the smart contract and if there are any changes I must be able to change 'id, true' -> 'id, false' to indicate that due to changes that reservation is not more valid.

Ie whenever the Chainlink Labs team deploys new versions of the aggregator, they update the proxy contract to set the current aggregator version to be the new one, and all new price data starts getting written to the new aggregator.\nBased on this, if you want historical price data for a proxy contract\/price pair from the last couple weeks or so, you'd need to go to the current aggregator for the proxy contract, then get the current round info (including timestamp), then go back in aggregator rounds in a loop until you get to a round that is less than your search parameter timestamp.\nTo find the current aggregator contract address for a proxy contract, you can call the aggregator getter function in the proxy contract.\nThe phase ID can be thought of as an incrementing ID number that the proxy contract uses to identify each aggregator as it gets added to the proxy, so the first one is 1, second is 2 etc. To find out what the current phase ID is of the current aggregator, you can use the phaseId getter function in the proxy contract.\nAggregator round IDs start from 1 and increase by 1 each time. Eg you can  use the aggregator latestRound getter function to find the last round that it stored, and then start from that number as an input parameter to getRoundData, and then reduce the number by one and loop through until you reach your point in time.\nUnlike Aggregator round IDs, proxy round IDs are those big really long numbers like 36893488147419113293, and are actually just a derived value based on the aggregator phase ID and the aggregator round ID. This is done to ensure the proxy round IDs are always increasing in value, and that there will never be any overlap between the same rounds across different aggregators, eg round 5000 from aggregator with phase ID 1 should have a lower proxy round ID that round 5000 from aggregator with phase ID 2\nIn Solidity you can easily replicate the proxy round ID derived value with the following formula, passing in the phase ID of the aggregator and the aggregator round ID\nreturn uint80(uint256(_phaseId) << 64 | _aggregatorRoundId);\n\nYou can even then take that derived value and pass it into the proxy contract getRoundData function, and get the same data result as calling getRoundData in the aggregator contract for the given aggregator round ID.\nI find A good way to play around with these is to interact with the functions directly on etherescan, and see the data returned. Ie here's the Kovan ETH\/USD proxy and its latest aggregator\nRegarding the answer your second question, the best way is to start from 'now', ie get the latest aggregator, grab the latest round in the aggregator and then go back in time by reducing the aggregator round ID by 1, and continue to get pricing info until the round timestamp is < your search timestamp.\nFinally, looping in Solidity is not very gas efficient. Another approach you can take is to off-load the external computation to an oracle, and the oracle can give you the correct round ID, and you can then take that and verify the results on-chain. Here's an example of that design pattern in the form of an external adapter that retrieves historical price data based on a timestamp. There is a live version of this running on Kovan too, check out the readme for more info","34":"Yes, by using configtxlator binary that's included.

Also, it depends on the smart contract payment model (end user pays the fees) works for you If this is it, then it is pretty simple. You might have an easier time in a smart contract model.

Given your example of a <blockchain> used for rental property use, I would assume that each transaction on the <blockchain> records who is currently renting the property. Using Alice and Bob as example names, let's say Alice is the current renter but her rental agreement has expired. If Bob wants to rent the place next, Alice would first transfer ownership back to the landlord, and from there the landlord would transfer ownership to Bob. On the <blockchain>, it would look something like this:\nAlice transfers ownership to Landlord\nLandlord transfers ownership to Bob\nNow, let say Bob wants to leave a review later on. How can we verify that Bob has been a previous renter? Well, it's simple. All we would need to do is go back through the <blockchain>'s history and check that rental ownership has been transferred to Bob at some point, which in this case it has. The <blockchain> is the database. Anyone who has had their names previously written down on the <blockchain> may leave a review.\nEDIT\nTo answer your question in the comments, how do we know that the transaction Alice transfers ownership to Landlord is true? Well, this transaction is considered valid if we can verify that Alice was the one to submit it. But how does this work?\nAlice would have been given a private key and a public key when setting up an address for the <blockchain>. You can think of the public key as a unique identifier for her, which in this case is just \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice\u00e2\u0080\u009d since there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other Alice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in this example. The private key is like a password: you need it in order to access your account and submit valid <transactions> to the <blockchain>.\nIn order for Alice to submit a valid transaction in her name, she would have to digitally sign it using her private key. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signing function that looks like this:\nSign(transaction, private key) = Signature\n\nGiven a transaction, Alice can use her private key to \u00e2\u0080\u009csign it\u00e2\u0080\u009d and produce a signature that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sent to the miner. When the miner gets this transaction along with the signature, they can verify using a second function:\nVerify(transaction, Signature, public key) = True\/False\n\nUsing this function, the miner can verify if the transaction WAS in fact made with the private key associated with the public key. If it was, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a valid transaction and can be added to the <blockchain>.\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the math behind these functions because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite complicated, so unfortunately I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain in detail here.\nI recommend watching 3Blue1Brown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video on Bitcoin, which goes over digital signing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long video but it goes over all of the basics of understanding <blockchain> in an easy to understand way.\nEDIT 2\nIn your second follow up question, there would have to be a rule coded into the <blockchain> that the Landlord cannot rent out the property to anyone else while there is a current renter. In this case, if the Landlord tries to submit this transaction while Alice is renting:\nLandlord transfers ownership to Bob\nthe validator would go back in the <blockchain>'s history and check that the last renter has transferred ownership back to the Landlord, which in this case is not true. The <blockchain> would still have Alice recorded down as the current renter, and so this transaction would be considered invalid. Since Alice is the only with the private key to her account, she's the only one that can transfer ownership back to the Landlord so it can be rented again.","163":null,"164":null,"165":null,"166":null,"167":null,"168":null,"169":null,"170":null,"171":null,"172":null,"173":"The behavior of miners and other nodes is determined by the specific protocol of the network.

To fix this connection issue you can either run an own full node or change the tier or the third party NaaS provider. Also it is recommended to use Chainlink version 0.10.8 or higher, as the HeadTracker has been revised here and performs more efficient.\nIn regard to the question let me try to give you a small technical overview, which may clarify the payload of a Chainlink node to it's remote full node:\nYour Chainlink node establishes a connection to a full node. There the Chainlink node initiates various subscriptions, which are a special feature of the websocket protocol to enable bidirectional communication. More precisely, this means that the Chainlink node is informed if a certain \"state\" of the subscription changes. Basically, the node interacts with using JSON-RPC methods and uses the following methods to initiate and process various functions internally:\neth_getBlockByNumber,eth_getBalance,eth_getTransactionReceipt,eth_getTransactionCount,eth_getLogs,eth_subscribe,eth_unsubscribe,eth_sendRawTransaction and eth_Call\nhttps:\/\/ethereum.org\/uk\/developers\/docs\/apis\/json-rpc\/\nThe high amount of interactions of the Chainlink node are especially executed during the syncing process via the internal HeadTracker service. This service initiates a \"head\" subscription in order to interact with every single incoming new blockheader.\nDuring this syncing process it uses the JSON-RPC methods eth_GetBlockByNumber and eth_getBalance to get all the necessary information from the block. So these two methods are used\/ executed every block. The number of requests now depends on the average blocktime of the network the Chainlink node is connected to\nAn example would be the Kovan Testnet:\nThe avg. blocktime here is 6.7sec, which means you get a daily request number of approx. 21.000\nDuring fulfilling job requests, those request also includes following methods: eth_getTransactionReceipt, eth_sendRawTransaction, eth_getLogs, eth_subscribe, eth_unsubscribe, eth_getTransactionCount and eth_call, which increases the total number significantly depending on the number of job requests.\nIt should also be noted that especially with faster <blockchain>s (e.g. polygon) there is a very high payload of the WebSocket and you have to deal with a good full node connection in detail, as many full nodes do not receive such a high number of requests permanently.","516":null,"517":"Yep!

If you know whether and what standard it implements, you can use a general ABI JSON that reflects on this standard (e.g. this is ABI JSON of a ERC-20 standard). However, it does not reflect any functions that the contract might have used to extend the standard-defined minimum.","630":"The ERC-721 standard does not define a \"best\" or \"correct\" way to mint new tokens (such as whether it should be open or restricted) and it's up to each contract developer to implement or omit the minting feature in a way that reflects their needs.\n\nCreating of NFTs (\"minting\") and destruction NFTs (\"burning\") is not included in the specification. Your contract may implement these by other means. Please see the event documentation for your responsibilities when creating or destroying NFTs.\n\nBut having a whitelist of addresses that are authorized to mint new tokens (e.g. MINTER_ROLE or onlyOwner) seems to be more common than allowing anyone to freely mint new tokens.\n\nEven though it's theoretically possible to deploy new contract each time a new token is minted, it's not a standard approach (and I personally haven't seen any contract that does it). In most cases the minting process \"just\" creates a new ID, stores a new string\/URL value associated with the ID, associates this new token with an owner address (of the token, not a contract owner), plus updates some metadata such as amount of tokens owned by an address (see example below).\nThe token owner can then transfer their tokens, give anyone control over their tokens, and do other stuff depending on the contract implementation.\nThe mappings that you point out in your question (_owners and _balances) suggest that they store token owner (not contract owner) addresses as well as amount of tokens held by each address.\nExample:\n\nContract owner mints token ID 1 to address 0x123.\n\nValue of _owners[1] is 0x123 (was 0, the default value)\n\nValue of _balances[0x123] becomes 1 (was 0, the default value)\n\n\n\nContract owner mints token ID 2 to address 0x123.\n\nValue of _owners[1] is still 0x123\n\nValue of _owners[2] is now 0x123 (was 0, the default value)\n\nValue of _balances[0x123] becomes 2 (because they now own 2 tokens)","631":null,"632":null,"633":"Bytecode of a smart contract is published in a transaction (that is mined in a block), and then stored in a storage of the network (usually Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain) associated with an address.\nSo each time when you're interacting with a smart contract, you're interacting with an address that is associated with a storage chunk containing the bytecode. Plus the bytecode points to other storage slots where the values of its variables are stored.\nAll state changes (including changes of the storage values) are part of the ledger database. The raw <blockchain> data only contain the state changes (not the current state), but most higher layers return the current state by default (you can still chose to fetch an older state, e.g. the \"defaultBlock\" param here).

It can also have a variable containing the funding goal. Comparing these two values tells you whether the goal has been reached and whether the smart contract should pay the project team.\nHowever, smart contracts currently don't have any native timers (such as cronjobs) or event handlers - and functions are executed after a transaction is sent to the address of the smart contract (data field of the transaction states what function you want to execute and what arguments you're passing).\nSo you need to either send the transaction (executing the withdraw() function) manually or using some offchain tool (that can watch the current balance and then send the transaction executing the function for you).\npragma solidity ^0.8;\n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint256 constant FUNDING_GOAL = 1 ether;\n    address constant TEAM_ADDRESS = address(0x123);\n\n    \/**\n     * Throws if the current balance is lower than the goal\n     * Otherwise sends all of the current balance to the predefined address\n     *\n     * Need to send transaction with correct value of the `data` field\n     * to execute this `withdraw()` function.\n     * Most client apps generate the correct value of `data` field for you\n     * after selecting the function name and specifying argument values.\n     *\/\n    function withdraw() external {\n        require(address(this).balance >= FUNDING_GOAL, 'Haven\\'t reached the funding goal');\n        payable(TEAM_ADDRESS).transfer(address(this).balance);\n    }\n    \n    \/**\n     * Allows this contract to receive native currency of the network (usually ETH or BNB)\n     *\/\n    receive() external payable {}\n}","634":null,"635":null,"636":null,"637":null,"638":null,"639":"If the burn() function has a public or external visibility modifier, you can execute it by submitting a transaction containing the function signature and the argument value(s) in the data field.\nOne of the ways is to build the data field value manually or semi-manually\nconst data = <web3>.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({\n    name: 'burn',\n    type: 'function',\n    inputs: [{\n        type: 'uint256',\n        name: '_amount'\n    }]\n}, [10000]);\n\nwhich returns\n0x42966c680000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002710\n\n\n42966c68 is the function signature\n2710 is hex value for 10000 (dec)\n\nand pass it to any wallet that supports custom data field (e.g. MyEtherWallet).\n\nAnother way is to instantiate your contract with <web3>.eth.Contract and execute the function from there.

That is not the purpose of Bitcoin so several pieces will be missing to really understand the integration of smart contracts.\nSorry for not directly following your questions, I just believe that a more detailed explanation is required to really understand how smart contracts are included \/ executed.\nAs you are asking about smart contracts let's take the practical example of Ethereum to explain how they are included in the <blockchain> and how to interact with them. ( The main idea is similar for other smart contract <blockchain>s )\nAccounts :\nLet's start by differentiating two types of Ethereum account :\n\nExternally Owned Accounts (EOA)\nContract Accounts (CA)\n\nExternally Owned Accounts:\nAn EOA is what you already know in Bitcoin, a user that holds a private key and a public address. An EOA is autonomous \/ proactive (You can decide to do something with your account whenever you want).\nAn EOA can send a public transaction as it can sign it with its private key.\nContract Accounts:\nA CA does not have private key but only a public address as you must be able to uniquely identify the smart contract on the <blockchain>. A CA is reactive only (A CA account actions will always be the result of an EOA action).\nA CA account cannot send a public transaction like an EOA would as it cannot sight it with a public key since it doesn't have one.\nIn Ethereum there is this notion of account state.\nBasically a mapping from addresses (EOA and CA) to a specific state.\nThe state of a specific account contains information's such as the balance and the nonce (number of <transactions> \/ contracts that this account created) and for CA this is expanded with code hash and storage hash.\n<transactions>\nA transaction can be:\n\nsmart contract creation\na value\/data transfer from account A to account B.\n\nSmart contract creation :\nThis transaction has no specific receiving address.\nIt includes data containing the smart contract code in the 'data' field.\nThe <blockchain> state will be updated to account for the new smart contract as long as this transaction is included in a block and consensus is reached.\nAn EOA address will be deterministically given to your smart contract (see this thread for an explanation on how it is done) and a new mapping is added in the account state for your smart contract containing the contract's code. You can now send transfer <transactions> to your smart contract address.\nValue\/Data transfer from account A to account B.\nNow let's say you want to call the method \"setName\" of your smart contract.\nYou or anyone can send a transaction from your account address (A) to the smart contract address (B) with the relevant information in the 'data' field (which method to call, parameters, etc..)\nThe execution itself will take place in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) where your contracts code will be interpreted and any change to the account states will be recorded.\nWith all of that in mind I suppose the answer to your questions will be clearer :\nBut how the computer program is getting executed?\nIt is executed inside the EVM on nodes. This execution will find it's origin in an EOA transaction calling the smart contract. The result of the execution is the changes to the account states.\nhow <transactions> are getting validated?\nSmart contracts cannot issue <transactions> as they are referenced as CA accounts. The original EOA transaction creating or calling the smart contract is validated as any other transaction and submitted to the normal consensus scheme of the <blockchain>.\nThe confusion might come from the fact that a smart contract can send funds to another address (EOA or CA), but they don't do so in the form of a public transaction.\nThis is possible because smart contracts are deterministic, therefore if you have the <blockchain> you have all the smart contract creation and smart contract calls in the form of <transactions> in the <blockchain>, and executing a smart contract in the EVM can change the account state. so if you send funds from (account A - EOA) to (account B - CA) that forwards them to (account C - EOA or CA) inside the EVM during its execution, it is recorded and replayable as everything is deterministic.\nSo if a smart contracts does something illegal ( spending more than its balance ) the original transaction that triggered it is invalid.\nhow consensus achieved?\nThere is no explicit consensus for smart contracts actions, it only directly concern blocks and <transactions>.\nWhile the whole answer is quite Ethereum specific, I hope it gives you a better idea of the integration of smart contracts in a <blockchain> system.","648":null,"649":"Your createProduct method returns nothing.

So in a sense, nobody can modify it, not even you, because it's immutable. I believe this confusion can be resolved with more background on how IPFS works.\nWhen you add things to IPFS each file is hashed, and given a CID. The same is true for directories, but their CID can more easily be understood as a sum of the contents of the directory. So if any files in the directory are updated, added, or deleted, the directory gets a new CID.\nUnderstanding this, if someone else added the exact same content in the exact same way, they'd end up with the exact same CID! With this, if two people added the same CID, and a third person requested that file (or directory), both nodes would be able to serve the data, as we know it's exactly the same. The same is true if you simply shared your CID and another node pinned it, both nodes would have the same data, so if anyone requested it, both nodes would be able to serve it.\nSo your local copy, cannot be edited by anyone. In a sense, if you're relying on the IPFS CID as the address of your data, not even by you! This is why IPFS is typically referred to as \"immutable\", because any data you request via an IPFS CID will always be the same. If you change any of the data, you'll get a new CID.\nMore info can be found here: Content Addressing & Immutability\nIf you read all this and thought \"well what if I want mutable data?\", I'd recommend looking into IPNS and possibly ipfs-sync if you're looking for a tool to automatically update IPNS for you.","726":"\"Memorizing\" the hashes of previous blocks is not workable, because a new node must be able to start from scratch (with no memory) and validate the previous blocks on its own.  It should not have to \"trust\" other nodes.  That is a major design goal of <blockchain>.\nThe hash difficulty is necessary to limit the speed at which new blocks can be created worldwide (for example one new block worldwide every 10 minutes).  If they could be created very quickly then a malicious node could create an incorrect (but valid looking) chain that is the longest of any other node's. The rule is that the longest chain is accepted.\nEDIT:\nJust to expand... <blockchain> design anticipates that occasionally a small number (say, 1 or 2) of malicious blocks could be added to the \"longest\" chain and would be accepted as valid temporarily. It is expected that the non-malicious majority of hashing power worldwide will eventually come up with an even longer chain that discards the malicious block(s) (performing a co-called \"<blockchain> rewrite\").\nThat is why it is recommended to wait for a certain number of blocks to be added (so-called \"confirmations\", e.g. 6) before accepting a new block as correct (because it is extremely unlikely to ever be rewritten at that point). It's also why the so-called \"51%\" attack (meaning the majority of worldwide hashing power is conspiring malliciously) is a vulnerability.","727":null,"728":null,"729":null,"730":null,"731":"Short answer: Currently not possible using Truffle. But if you know what you're doing, you could keep the storage with more low-level approach.\n\nBy running truffle migrate you are usually running a javascript code that deploys the Solidity contract using the standard CREATE EVM opcode. So every time you're running truffle migrate, Truffle deploys the contract to a new address that has empty storage slots.\nEven though it's possible to redeploy a smart contract to an already used address using CREATE2 opcode (and to keep the original storage data), Truffle currently doesn't support this option.\nNote: The --reset option only runs all migrations from the beginning in case of previous failure, but has no effect on the storage or the contract address.\n\nYou could achieve this goal (keeping the storage) by setting the (contract deployment) transaction data to an instruction to deploy to an address that already contains a self-destruct contract.

If so, wouldn't this create a mess on the <transactions> signed on the chain? Since each miner (therefore peer) signing its own reward would use a different <blockchain> wallet than the other peers? Wouldn't this lead to any problems?\n\nYou don't say what problems you think this will lead to. I can't think of any.\n\nFor what I think is definitively more straightforward to use the fee amount to reward the miner, but this doesn't solve my doubts at all. Since the outputs of the <transactions> are signed upon creation, how could the peer initiating the transaction know upfront the possible miner who finds the block? And if he can't know it, how could possibly the miner \"extract\" its reward without tampering the transaction itself?\n\nThe simplest solution to this is for the transaction itself to just contain its inputs and outputs. The fee is the difference between the total inputs and the total outputs.\nThe miner just includes the transaction in the block of <transactions> they mine. They also add one additional transaction into the block, sending themselves the reward. Obviously, they know their own destination address. Every participant who receives the newly-mined block checks to make sure this transaction is valid (just as they check every other one) and doesn't claim a larger reward than is allowed.\n\nAnd if the answer is not to generate a new wallet each time, where could you possibly store that very first private key of the chain's wallet where no one can see it, but still be able to use it, without having to put a server in the middle?\n\nTypically in a file on the local disk. The private key isn't really needed anyway -- you only need it to send. You don't need it to mine or report. So it can be prompted for or decrypted only when actually needed.\n\nOf course it could create a new transaction, and add that to the block. But who would sign that transaction? From where those reward tokens come?\n\nThe usual rule is that the reward transaction has no inputs, one output, and no signature. The tokens come from the pool of unclaimed miner reward tokens which can be finite or infinite depending on the <blockchain>'s design.

The backend has a hot wallet with ETH balance to be able to create and broadcast <transactions>.\nThe transaction is pushed to Ethereum API node over JSON-RPC. The node broadcasters the transaction to P2P network. A miner picks up the transaction from the mempool. A new block is created. The miner broadcasts the newly crated block back to the peer-to-peer network. Your Ethereum node picks up the new block. <web3>.js backend application polls or subscribes events related to the smart contracts from your Ethereum node. Backend event <web3>.js handlers are fired for the state changes in the new block.\nNote that the blocks can be also rolled back in the case of a minor <blockchain> reorganisation. In the case or reorganisation, the event handlers fire again (twice, thrice, etc.) for each competing block. Minor <blockchain> reorganisation may occur many times in an hour. The current state is probabilistic, so you always need to wait for a few blocks to be sure.\nFor events and <transactions> by other actors in the <blockchain>, you just subscribe to the events and process them as new blocks arrive from miners to your node.","852":null,"853":null,"854":null,"855":"You have to convert argument of decodefunctions tobytes.

Many programming languages have a way to convert a human readable date to the timestamp (unfortunately, Solidity currently can do that only on a very limited basis - only from a relative expression such as \"now + 1 year\", but not from an absolute date such as \"2021-12-31\").

A call to an async function without await returns a promise and moves on to the next line while the promise is still pending. If you instead put await in front of the async function, Javascript will keep doing something else until the promise resolves a value.

You can also further check by importing the first account of ganache in Metamask. Just get the private key of the first account from ganache-cli console and paste it in Metamask. Make sure that correct balance is also shown in Metamask after account is created. Its even better if you run ganache-cli with a mnemonic with a -m \"string\" flag.

About the ABI and Contract Address part. this needs to be valid. I am passing the ABI in the same way like yours after reading from JSON file. This seems ok since it needs a JSON interface for ABI.

If your contract is actually meant to work with all these versions, you should use the older form (pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2) which works also before 0.7.4.

You do not need it for value types like uint or address or if the function is internal.

So there's two solutions for that, you can either add \"pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;\" on top of your current code, or use solidity 0.8.X version, also, mind specifying your solidity compiler version on your truffle config, since by default it will use the truffle's version: i.prntscr.com\/w50AcCbxTeeKADGLpDlvOQ.png .\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0MrFrenzoid\n                \n                Jul 31, 2021 at 9:55,You're welcome, yet, please consider closing the question (validating the answer or else) .\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0MrFrenzoid\n                \n                Aug 1, 2021 at 16:46","484":null,"485":null,"486":null,"487":null,"488":null,"489":"Where the suri come from?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0gfan\n                \n                Nov 26, 2021 at 1:58","490":null,"491":null,"492":null,"493":null,"494":"Thank you.

They usually have a public API acting as a \"middleware\" before the actual request to the Tron daemon... So I can imagine there's protection on a router level, as well as on the HTTP server (e.g. nginx) for their public API \"middleware\". Most providers also use rate limiting of how many requests per sec\/min can each (valid) API key request... Only if the request is not stopped by the previous steps, the API \"middleware\" sends the eth_* request to the Tron daemon running on their (other) server, and proxies back the response.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Petr Hejda\n                \n                Jun 9, 2021 at 13:10","573":null,"574":null,"575":null,"576":null,"577":null,"578":null,"579":null,"580":null,"581":null,"582":null,"583":null,"584":null,"585":null,"586":null,"587":null,"588":"Thanks.

This will send you a message each time when there's a new block, and you can use the provided block.number (from the message) to request the specific block (or simply the \"latest\")... A workaround with a HTTP provider would be to poll the <web3>.eth.getBlock(\"latest\") (e.g. each second using setTimeout()) but that might hit the rate limits of your provider.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Petr Hejda\n                \n                Jun 5, 2021 at 11:26,@DavidJay Ethers.js uses the latest block as default.

So you understand when the file is updated, the dir CID changes, you update that in Solidity, great. So wouldn't the question be more \"who can update the tokenuri method?\" as anyone could download your IPFS files, change them, and upload them with a new CID, as IPFS is completely open. However your tokenuri method I'm assuming has permission involved, and that's really the content that's being pointed to. So the real problem to address is \"Who can update the TokenURI?\" and if that's just you, sounds like you're all set.\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Discordian\n                \n                Apr 10, 2021 at 16:15,@Discoradian Thanks for responding again.

So I strongly discourage that... I'm not that familiar with the NFTs practical examples that much, so I don't know any examples, but I'm sure if you DYOR, you'll find examples. My answer is based on observing and writing implementations of ERC-20, where you also don't see many contracts defining 2+ tokens (even for the practical reasons that Etherscan and other <blockchain> explorers would not recognize 2+ tokens in the same contract).\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Petr Hejda\n                \n                Feb 20, 2021 at 1:13,OK got it. Makes sense. And yes, when I said \"not allowed\" I did mean that you certainly could change method signatures if you wanted to - but then you'd no longer be conformant to the ERC721 standards.  I will continue researching this - and hopefully others will chime in with their advice as it could be useful to others.

So you already have Weapons and Vehicles, and now you want to add Potions for example. Is there a way to design your GameContract so that it's able to accept new elements\/ERC721 contracts and Tokens so you can keep growing it?\n                \n                \n\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Sirab33\n                \n                Feb 21, 2021 at 1:46","799":null,"800":null,"801":"Exactly.
